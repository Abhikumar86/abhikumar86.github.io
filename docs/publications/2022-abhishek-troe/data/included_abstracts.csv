The assessment of vulnerability of forests in the Indian Western Himalayan (IWH) region comprising the states of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Uttarakhand (UK) was done using six indicators of vulnerability in the form of biological richness index, disturbance index, forest canopy density, fire point intensity and forest extraction intensity of fringe forests. We express this assessment as the indicator-based vulnerability. The indicators were allocated weights by multi criteria analysis using analytical hierarchy process. The spatial extent of all of the selected indicators was mapped for the IWH region at a pixel resolution of 24 m and was integrated to find out the vulnerability for each pixel in a GIS environment. The study area was divided into 172 grids of size 0.5, equivalent to the grid size of available climatic projections, out of which 67 grids were identified as the forest grids. The grids that have at least 5% forest cover were designated as the forest grids and the vulnerability assessment was done only for these grids. The final representation of vulnerability across forested grids of the IWH was done at a spatial resolution of 5' and 0.5 to categorise as low, medium, high and very high class. It was observed that the highest concentration of very high and high vulnerable grids of 5' size lies in the state of UK, comprising 32 and 31%, respectively. The aggregated values at 0.5 indicate that most of the grids of UK fall under very high vulnerability except for the few uppermost and lowermost grids falling under other categories. In J&K, most of the 5' grids fall under low vulnerability (41%), while medium, high and very high categories are 27, 25 and 7%, respectively. Similarly, out of total 28 grids of size 0.5, only one grid is categorized as very high vulnerable, while 11 grids fall under high vulnerability. In HP, none of the grids of either size is categorized as very high vulnerable. It was observed that most of the high and very high vulnerable grids in the IWH are in the lower altitudes while higher altitudes have lesser magnitude of vulnerability. Forests occurring at a higher elevation such as the Alpine forests (dry, moist and sub-alpine) is the least vulnerable forests compared to other forest type groups of the IWH. 2021 The Authors","Elsevier B.V.","English","Deforestation;  Ecosystems;  Extraction;  Fires;  Image resolution;  Pixels;  Sustainable development, Analytical Hierarchy Process;  Disturbance index;  Forest ecosystem;  Forest fires;  Forest resource extraction;  Integrated approach;  Sustainable management;  Vulnerability;  Vulnerability assessments;  Western himalayas, Climate change, alpine environment;  analytical hierarchy process;  environmental disturbance;  forest canopy;  forest cover;  forest ecosystem;  GIS;  pixel;  spatial resolution;  vulnerability, Himachal Pradesh;  Himalayas;  India;  Jammu and Kashmir;  Uttarakhand, Indicator indicator","1470160X","10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107568",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Indicator-Based Vulnerability Assessment of Forest Ecosystem in the Indian Western Himalayas: An Analytical Hierarchy Process Integrated Approach.","selected",NA,"selected"

Samples were analyzed for assessment of physico-chemical properties at four soil depths, viz., 015, 1530, 3045, and 4560 cm. A total of 120 soil samples were collected in both the seasons. Soil texture was found to be sandy loam and slightly alkaline in nature. The relative trend of soil organic carbon (SOC), macro-and micro-nutrient content for the five LUSs was forest > orchard > grassland > wheatrice > sugarcane, in the pre-and post-monsoon seasons. SOC was highly correlated with macronutrients and micronutrients, whereas SOC was negatively correlated with soil pH (r = 0.818). The surface soil layer (015 cm) had a significantly higher content of SOC, and macro-and micro-nutrients compared to the sub-surface soil layers, due to the presence of more organic content in the soil surface layer. Tukeys multiple comparison test was applied to assess significant difference (p <0.05) among the five LUSs at four soil depths in both the seasons. Principle component analysis (PCA) identified that SOC and electrical conductivity (EC) were the most contributing soil indicators among the different land use systems, and that the post-monsoon season had better soil quality compared to the pre-monsoon season. These indicators helped in the assessment of soil health and fertility, and to monitor degraded agroecosystems for future soil conservation. 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, it is vital to understand the role of different forests in regulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of atmospheric CO2 concentration. In this study, we have used eddy covariance (EC) tower-based atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements and satellite-retrieved column average CO2 concentration of 2018 to understand the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of atmospheric CO2 concentration over the sub-tropical forest in the foothills of northwest Himalaya, Uttarakhand, India. EC study revealed that the CO2 concentration over the forest canopy peaks during mid-night to early morning and drop to a minimum during the afternoon. On a monthly scale, peak atmospheric CO2 concentration was observed during July in both the sites, which was a result of more release of CO2 by the forest ecosystem through ecosystem respiration and microbial decomposition. Enhanced photosynthetic activities during the late monsoon and post-monsoon resulted in the decrease of atmospheric CO2 concentration over the forest ecosystem. Among the meteorological variables, rainfall was found to have the highest control over the seasonal variability of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite-retrieved column average CO2 (XCO2) was also examined to comprehend its reliability on an ecosystem scale. The OCO-2 retrieved XCO2 value was higher than the EC carbon flux tower-measured atmospheric CO2 concentration, which might be due to differences in the vertical resolution of the CO2 column and scale difference. However, the monthly atmospheric XCO2 retrieved from OCO-2 strongly adheres with the ground-measured monthly pattern. Our study highlights that forests with varying functional traits within the same climatic conditions show variability in the regulation of atmospheric CO2 concentration. 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Atmospheric thermodynamics;  Dynamics;  Ecosystems;  Forestry;  Greenhouse effect;  Orbits;  Satellites;  Tropics, Ecosystem respiration;  Eddy covariance towers;  Meteorological variables;  Microbial decomposition;  Photosynthetic activity;  Seasonal variability;  Spatio-temporal dynamics;  Subtropical forests, Carbon dioxide, atmospheric pollution;  broad-leaved forest;  carbon cycle;  carbon dioxide;  concentration (composition);  deciduous forest;  eddy covariance;  forest canopy;  greenhouse gas;  NDVI;  seasonal variation;  subtropical region, Himalayas;  India, carbon dioxide, ecosystem;  environmental monitoring;  forest;  India;  reproducibility;  season, Carbon Dioxide;  Ecosystem;  Environmental Monitoring;  Forests;  India;  Reproducibility of Results;  Seasons","01676369","10.1007/s10661-021-08896-4","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Seasonal Dynamics and Impact Factors of Atmospheric Co2 Concentration over Subtropical Forest Canopies: Observation from Eddy Covariance Tower and Oco-2 Satellite in Northwest Himalaya, India.","selected",NA,"selected"

However, the CO2 carbon exchange characteristics (Gross Primary Productivity, Net Ecosystem Exchange, and Ecosystem respiration) of Indian forests are poorly understood. Immense carbon sequestration opportunities exist with the natural as well as planted forests. Therefore, it becomes vital to assess the potential of existing forests (natural and planted) by means of the most accurate and reliable methods of eddy covariance (EC). It is also important to know the eco-physiological response of the forests towards diurnal, seasonal, and yearly changes in the prevailing environmental conditions. We analyzed CO2 carbon exchange characteristics of a mature moist deciduous forest and a young mixed deciduous plantation located in the sub-tropical climate regime in the western Himalayan foothills of India with the help of co-located EC measurements (2016 to 2018). The study reveals that both the mature forest ( 719.43 gCm 2year 1) and young plantation ( 467.49 gC m 2 year 1) are absorbing a significant amount of atmospheric CO2 carbon. The maximum uptake of atmospheric CO2 occurred during the post-monsoon season in both the forests. The minimum NEE of the mixed deciduous plantation was observed during the leaf fall period while the NEE of the moist deciduous forest was the lowest in monsoon due to a higher respiration rate during monsoon. Among the environmental factors, soil moisture showed maximum control on the productivity of both the forest ecosystems. The value reported in this study can help Forest Survey of India in establishing/assessing emission factor for these particular forest types. This study can also help forest managers in carbon assessment of plantation under NDC. 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","canopy exchange;  carbon dioxide;  carbon sequestration;  deciduous forest;  diurnal variation;  eddy covariance;  leaf litter;  plantation;  seasonality;  soil respiration, Himalayas;  India","01682563","10.1007/s10533-020-00727-x","2-3",NA,NA,NA,"291-311","Environmental Control on Carbon Exchange of Natural and Planted Forests in Western Himalayan Foothills of India.","selected",NA,"selected"

However, the physical attributes of paleosols subjected to burial cannot be used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. In contrast, selective pedogenic tracers such as rare earth (REE) and trace elements, and organic proxies such as pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios, and D/H and 13C/12C ratios of n-alkanes that are resistant to post-depositional processes can provide insight into pedogenic conditions. Although the upper Miocene Siwalik paleosols from the Himalayan Foreland Basin (HFB) have been used for past vegetation and climate reconstructions, little emphasis has been given to understand their formation. In this regard, the Jabbarkhad Siwaliks of the Kangra sub-basin, identified as distal alluvial fan deposits with records of temporal variability in rainfall and vegetation composition, have been used to investigate the combined impact of depositional environment, topography, climate and vegetation composition on paleosol formation. Prominent negative Eu-anomalies in CI-normalised REE patterns along with uniform ratios of refractory elements suggest a dominant and consistent source of sediments from K-rich granitic upper continental crust. A wide variation in the abundance of REE indicates the modification of sediments by pedogenetic processes. In the Jabbarkhad region, oxic (higher Pr/Ph) and well-drained soils favoured the proliferation of grasses. The high root density and organic turnover of grasses facilitated the development of a mature, strongly leached soil (high Ba/Sr) under high rainfall and humid conditions (lower 2 values). Less mature (lower Ba/Sr) paleosols were developed in low-lying anoxic (Pr/Ph &lt;1) floodplain areas dominated by C3 trees near the active channel. Comparison of soil maturity from the Gangetic floodplain, a modern analogue of the Siwalik sediments, suggests that the spatial variability of paleosol maturity was controlled by the landscape mosaic of the Siwalik floodplain. Since pedogenesis and vegetation distribution are controlled by floodplain morphology, sampling of paleosols with similar pedogenic and geomorphic characteristics is essential for evaluation of vegetation distribution in temporally separated paleosols. 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","English","alluvial fan;  foreland basin;  Miocene;  monsoon;  paleoclimate;  paleosol;  pedogenesis;  rare earth element;  sediment analysis;  trace element;  tracer;  vegetation structure, Gangetic Plain;  Himachal Pradesh;  Himalayas;  India;  Kangra;  Siwalik Hills, Poaceae","00310182","10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109854",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Impact of Monsoon, Vegetation, and Landscape on Pedogenesis: a Case Study using Organic and Inorganic Tracers from the Himalayan Foreland Sediments.","selected",NA,"selected"

The phenological events of these species were recorded in order to determine the relationship between environmental factors (temperature and precipitation) and phonological events. The main branches and sub-branches of individuals of each species were randomly selected and marked with metal tags to represent the whole canopy from January, 2017 to December, 2018. The data was analyzed with the help of circular statistics and Spearman's rank correlation. The result showed that leaf bud initiation start from February and peaks in May. Young leaves start expanded in April and peaks in July, whereas leaf senescence starts in August. Leaf fall starts from September and peaks in November. Flower/flowering bud starts from February to March and turns into flower in April. Ripening of fruits starts from April and peaks in May while fruit fall occurs in May and peaks in June. It is concluded that environmental factors play important role in timing and recurring of phenophase events in all the species.

Soil microbial communities compete for nutrient and space and form mutualistic associations with host plants. Rhizosphere, the connecting site of plant roots with soil, influences the soil health and plant-microbe interactions. Soil enzyme activity, which is considered to be the biological indicator of soil health, is significantly influenced by microbial functioning. Betula utilis D. Don is a dominant treeline forming species that has been extensively studied for the impact of climate-mediated variations in sub-alpine Himalayan region. However, the microbial ecology of this species remains almost unexplored. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the endophytic communities associated with B. utilis roots along with the status of enzymes, nutrients, and microbial communities in rhizosphere soil in two seasons from three sites in North-Western Himalaya. Activity of soil enzymes (acid and alkaline phosphatase, aryl sulfatase, -glucosidase, urease and dehydrogenase) varied statistically with respect to seasons. Except dehydrogenase, the soil enzymes activity correlated with pH, organic carbon, and phosphorus content in soil. High dehydrogenase activity is attributed to high microbial activity in dormant season. B. utilis roots were found to be colonized with a range of microbial communities namely, mycorrhizae, dark septate endophytes (DSE), bacterial endophytes and unidentified nematode like structures (NLS). While, in general, DSE colonization was higher during growing season, mycorrhizae dominated the roots during dormant season. Significant differences were obtained only in mycorrhizal colonization with respect to seasons and sites. Further, significant correlations were obtained among soil nutrients, enzyme activity, and microbial counts during growing season. B. utilis roots exerted negative rhizosphere effect on microbial communities.

One sample Z score test and regression analysis were performed to workout the relative proportion of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants in different altitudinal belts and relationship of mycorrhizal symbiosis with increasing altitude, respectively. With increasing altitude, the mycorrhizal association of both the alien and native plant species showed a decreasing trend, although alien plant species showed much stronger negative values than native species do. Both aliens and native species showed significantly higher proportion of mycorrhizal species compared to non-mycorrhizal counterparts in all the vegetation zones (Temperate, Montane, Sub-alpine and Alpine). Interestingly, in none of the vegetation zones do aliens and natives differ in terms of their mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal species fractions, suggesting that change in mycorrhizal symbioses along any elevational gradient occurs more due to restrictions on mycorrhizal fungi survival than due to the identity of the species concerned.

The present study aimed to understand the composition, distribution pattern, phenology and physiognomic traits of riverine vegetation in Bhaderwah, Jammu and Kashmir, India. Materials and Methods: Organized field surveys were conducted in a mountainous riparian corridor of Neeru stream in Bhaderwah during 2016-2017. The study area forms a linear hydro-morphological unit spanning 30 km in length and ~15-100 m wide located along an elevational range of 850-2200 m. A random sampling technique was used for vegetation sampling. Results: The study corridor is well represented by subtropical, sub-temperate, temperate and alpine elements of vegetation. In all, 248 plant species contained in 193 genera and 78 families were recorded from 45 sampling stations surveyed for all the seasons. Asteraceae dominated the area with 27 species in 20 genera. The life-form spectra revealed thero-hemicryptophytic type of phytoclimate with the prevalence of microphylls (46.37%). Conclusion: The study area comprises of rich diversity of herbs followed by shrubs and trees with a pronounced mid domain effect observed for species and familial richness. The observations on leaf size and biological spectra reflect the characteristics of moderately disturbed temperate ecosystem. The flowering and fruiting commence early at the lower elevations and vegetation remains dormant during winters.

Roadside plantations often act as a first defense line against the vehicular emissions to mitigate the impacts of pollutants. However, they are themselves vulnerable to these pollutants with varying levels of tolerance capacity. This demands a scientific investigation to assess the role of roadside plantation for better management and planning for urban sprawl where selected trees could be grown to mitigate the impacts of harmful pollutants. The present study assesses the impacts of vehicular emissions on the adaptation and mitigation potential of two important roadside tree species i.e. Grevillea robusta and Mangifera indica planted along roadsides in the capital city of Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand is one of the Indian Western Himalayan State and its capital city is situated on the foothills of Himalaya. The adaptation and mitigation potential were evaluated by studying the response of pollutants on the functional traits which drive the physiology of the trees. The CO2 assimilation rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency (WUE), air pollution tolerance index (APTI), copper and proline accumulation, dust removal efficiency (DRE), leaf thickness and cooling created by plantation were studied to evaluate the response of trees exposed to roadside traffics. To compare the influence of pollutants, traits of trees grown in a control site with few or absence of vehicular movement were compared with the roadside trees. The control site represented part of a reserve forest where human interference is controlled and human-induced activities are prohibited. The vehicular frequency was found to modulate tree characteristics. The tree characteristics representing WUE, APTI, proline and copper accumulation, leaf thickness, cooling impact, and DRE were enhanced significantly, while the decreased CO2 assimilation rate was observed near roadside trees compared to the control site. We found both of the species to perform well to be used as one of the potential species for roadside and urban greening. However, there is a need to assess the potential of other species in reference to the present study. 2020 Singh et al.

Other environmental variables may also influence the species diversity on the northern faces of the mountain and therefore needs to be studied in detail. The northern slopes represent three different sub-slopesnorth, north east, and north west. During the current investigation of Pir-Panjal and Dauladhar ranges in Bhadarwah valley, fine-scale studies on the relationship between vegetation and four variables (soilpH, moisture content, electrical conductivity, and steepness) were conducted. The study determined the role of these variables on the vegetation of three different sub-slopes. The sampling was done at the confluence of two communities (forest and grassland) at three sites on the northern sub-slopes of the lesser stratum in western Himalayan. Results: The result revealed that rich herbaceous diversity prevails on the lesser Himalayan stratum (Bhadarwah valley). As many as 65.8% species differ from site to site, whereas species commonality among the sites is minimum. The role of environmental variables on the species composition at different sub-slopes of the north mountain face is deduced through canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Conclusions: The availability of solar light increases air and soil temperature on the north eastfacing slope. All the environmental variables (soilpH, moisture,electrical conductivity, and mountain steepness) are insignificant at pure north face for the species composition. Therefore, it can be concluded that some other environmental variables may influence the species composition which are needed to be furtherinvestigated. 2019, The Author(s).","Springer","English","Electric conductivity;  Moisture;  Soils;  Vegetation, Canonical Correspondence Analysis;  Environmental variables;  North face;  Species heterogeneity;  Species turnover;  Treeline, Landforms, canonical analysis;  community composition;  correspondence analysis;  ecotone;  environmental conditions;  herb;  heterogeneity;  species richness, Pir Panjal Range, Tracheophyta","21921709","10.1186/s13717-019-0200-x","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Environmental Variables Vis-a-Vis Distribution of Herbaceous Tracheophytes on Northern Sub-Slopes in Western Himalayan Ecotone.","selected",NA,"selected"

Landscape distinguished by the heterogeneity of structure, forms, human interferences, and environmental settings plays an important role in the establishment and spread of invasive species. We investigated the effect of the spatial heterogeneity for a selected landscape upon the invasion process through a case study of Hyptis (Hyptis suaveolens) in the Indian Western Himalayan region. The selected study site constitutes a heterogeneous landscape of 32,300 ha in the state of Uttarakhand, placed at the lower elevation of the Indian Himalaya. The landscape has varying levels and patterns of Hyptis invasion. We quantified the spatial heterogeneity in terms of elevation; distance from the canal, river, road, and settlement; and 18 landscape metrics (at the patch and land use class level) to investigate their influence on the invasion; for this purpose, a logistic regression model was developed. The invasion of Hyptis was found to be governed by spatial heterogeneity. The highest probability of invasion was found in the areas adjacent to rivers and roads. The analysis at patch level revealed that the invasion is largely governed by the perimeter-area ratio of patches and is positively correlated. This suggests for greater invasion chances in smaller patches as compared with larger ones. The analysis for the land use class metrics indicated a higher influence of edge density expressed as total edge length of patches per unit area, followed by patch density expresses as a total number of patches per unit area. Hence, the landscapes with larger edges and more number of patches are supposed to be more prone to invasion risks. The results of the study can be used by forest managers in designing a landscape-level system to control invasion. 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer","English","Biodiversity;  Climate change;  Land use;  Regression analysis, Alien plants;  Biological invasion;  Heterogeneous landscapes;  Human interference;  Landscape metrics;  Logistic Regression modeling;  Spatial heterogeneity;  Sub-pixel classification, Plants (botany), angiosperm;  introduced species;  invasive species;  landscape ecology;  logistics;  pixel;  regression analysis;  spatiotemporal analysis, Article;  environmental aspects and related phenomena;  highway;  Hyptis;  Hyptis suaveolens;  Indian;  land use;  landscape;  nonhuman;  population dynamics;  regression analysis;  river;  seasonal variation;  spatial heterogeneity;  species invasion;  biodiversity;  ecosystem;  environmental monitoring;  introduced species;  plant, Himalayas, Hyptis;  Hyptis suaveolens, Biodiversity;  Ecosystem;  Environmental Monitoring;  Hyptis;  Introduced Species;  Plants","01676369","10.1007/s10661-019-7682-y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Does Spatial Heterogeneity of Landscape Explain the Process of Plant Invasion? a Case Study of Hyptis Suaveolens from Indian Western Himalaya.","selected",NA,"selected"

To fill this research gap, the whole district was ecologically explored for the collection of field data from August 2014 to July 2016. For vegetation studies, a total of 16 altitudinal transects comprising 110 sampling stations (samples) with 990 plots were studied by using a stratified random vegetation sampling method. Different multivariate statistical tools including Monte Carlo permutation test, Indicator species analysis, hierarchical clustering, ordination, variation partitioning and multi-response permutation procedures tests were used for the first time for the study area to elucidate the number of significant vegetation groups, ranking and placement of plant species in these groups, classification of vegetation units, detection of important gradients, importance of groups of environmental variables and pairwise compositional differences of the species groups respectively. The results showed that all the recorded 343 plant species belong to seven significant plant associations which were further placed into 5 major forest types. Out of the total 19 variables studied, CCA detected the significant contribution of the majority (simple effects: 12; unique effects: 8) of them. The latter (unique effects) in descending order included altitude, forest cover, deforestation, community maturity, forest density, latitude, slope aspect, and longitudinal variations. Similarly, variation partitioning results depicted that topography was the leading driver affecting vegetation distribution, followed by the biotic and edaphic factors. The forest edges, especially the sub-alpine ecosystem, were most diverse, supported higher tree density and also faced maximum deforestation pressure. Furthermore, rangelands in the temperate to alpine zones were affected by heavy overgrazing.

Hence, there is a need for better understanding of the drivers of forest fire to aid efficient management, but these efforts are hampered by the deficiency of spatial and temporal data on fire incidences. Advancement in remote sensing technology provides an opportunity to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of wildfires in relation to anthropogenic, ecological, and environmental drivers. We used MODIS fire data from 2001 to 2015 to understand fire incidences in Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR), an important tiger habitat area in the Himalayan terai region. We analyzed fire incidences to understand monthly and inter-annual variation of fire incidences at two spatial scales: first, using only climatic variables considering VTR as a single spatial unit and the second, to understand the fire dynamics at 1 km2 spatial resolution using climatic, ecological, and anthropogenic variables. The results show that fire incidences occurred from January to May, 88% of which occurred in March and April. Overall, different variables affected fire incidences in March and April for both the temporal models. Precipitation had a significant negative effect on fire incidences in both March and April, but temperature had a positive effect only in March. Similarly, the fine scale temporal model showed that while ecological (litter load, NPP) and anthropogenic (distance to villages and roads) variables influenced fire incidences in March, altitude and village area surrounding the forest affected fires in April. Litter input, distance to nearest villages, and village area had a non-linear relationship with fire incidences indicating a few inconsistencies with the global patterns of fire with human activity. We show that the Sal dominated forests and terai grasslands at low altitudes (200 m), falling within a zone of 2.53 km from villages and with good road connectivity are more prone to fire. The fine-scale fire prediction map of VTR will be helpful to the Tiger Reserve management in developing appropriate strategies for the fire prone areas. 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","English","Climate change;  Deforestation;  Ecology;  Environmental technology;  Fire hazards;  Highway administration;  Radiometers;  Remote sensing;  Rural areas;  State space methods, Anthropogenic influence;  Fire management;  Forest fires;  Himalayan terai;  MODIS;  Negative binomial models;  Poisson regression, Fires, annual variation;  anthropogenic effect;  conservation management;  conservation planning;  environmental factor;  felid;  forest fire;  human activity;  MODIS;  Poisson ratio;  protected area;  regression analysis;  remote sensing;  satellite data;  spatial resolution;  spatiotemporal analysis;  tropical forest;  vegetation structure, Area;  Data;  Deforestation;  Ecology;  Forest Fires;  Patterns;  Remote Sensing;  Variables, Himalayas","03781127","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.10.009",NA,NA,NA,NA,"902-911","a Fine-Scale State-Space Model to Understand Drivers of Forest Fires in the Himalayan Foothills.","selected",NA,"selected"

The disparity in the abundance of C4 plants across different regions of the Kangra sub-basin, NW Himalaya, has been attributed to variation in grain size of the substrate and its moisture content. In the absence of vegetation and climate data from the Upper Siwaliks of the Kangra sub-basin, the present study considers the adjacent Subathu sub-basin. The 13C values of soil carbonate nodule (SC) from the Ghaggar and Moginanda regions and fossil tooth enamel from the Haripur Khol region of the Subathu sub-basin have been measured and compared to data from the other Siwalik regions to assess the spatio-temporal distribution of C4 plants. Additionally, the 18OSC values have been evaluated to reconstruct local climatic conditions. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope data from SC across the Siwaliks indicate that climate was not the only driver influencing the C4 plant abundance. Comparison of the sedimentary architecture among the different Siwalik regions indicates that the abundance of overbank fine sediments is higher in the western Siwaliks than the central and eastern Siwaliks.

Tree species richness, density, basal area and the diversity indices were found significantly (P<0.05) decreased with the increasing level of disturbances whereas, shrub density, basal area and herb density significantly increased with increasing disturbance level. In case of shrubs, Simpsons dominance index significantly (P<0.007) increased along the disturbance gradient, whereas Pielous evenness index significantly (P<0.005) decreased with an increasing level of disturbance. Shannon-Weiner diversity index for herbs significantly (P<0.016) increased with increasing disturbance whereas, Simpsons dominance index was significantly (P<0.013) declined along the disturbance gradient. Results revealed that 1050 cm dbh classes constituted the highest stem density, and highest basal area was recorded in the >100 cm dbh class in all three sites. Density of the matured trees decreased with increasing DBH whereas, tree basal area tended to increase with increasing DBH in all three sites. Tree species richness was highest in the lower DBH classes. 62.07% of the total tree species regenerated in the largely undisturbed site followed by 50% in the mildly disturbed and 26.32% in the highly disturbed site. The overall regeneration condition was found to be good in the largely undisturbed site. Mildly disturbed site exhibited fair regeneration and so was in the highly disturbed site. Discernable variations in species composition, diversity, regeneration and tree population structure revealed the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on rainforest vegetation dynamics. Higher degree of disturbance was furtherly found not only affecting species diversity but also promoting the growth of invasive weed species. Dominance of Hydnocarpus kurzii and Crypteronia paniculata in the highly disturbed site also indicated that these less-valued timber species may benefit from the vegetation mosaic produced by the disturbance; so differences in abundance of these species may be useful for bio-indication.

Muzaffarabad district as part of western Himalayan is a strongly seasonal area, thus studies on interrelationship of timing of phenological periodic events and climatic seasonality is of obvious significance. A first ever detailedeco-taxonomical field survey of the whole district was conducted to explore floral diversity, plant habit associated with microhabitats. Timing of flowering response of species within the different months was also recorded during two consective years (2014-16) and flowering phonological data was stored as binary data matrix. The influence of studied climatic variables on the flowering phenological response was tested through canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). A total of 748 vascular plants (740 species, 3 sub-species, 5 varieties) belonged to 490 genera and 120 plant families were recorded including 77 species as new to the study area. The leading plant family was Compositae (69 spp., 9.22%), followed by Poaceae (57 spp., 7.62%), Leguminosae (54 spp., 7.22%), Lamiaceae (42 spp., 5.61%) and Rosaceae (29 spp., 3.88%); while the leading genus was Euphorbia (10 spp.), followed by Cyperus, Ficus, Geranium and Prunus (7spp. each). With respect to life forms, perennial herbs were the most dominant (297 spp., 39.71%), followed by annual herbs (188 spp., 25.13%). With reference to diversity of microhabitats, coniferous forest was leading in terms of floristic diversity having 243 species (32.10% of total flora), followed by drier slopes, home gardens (158 spp., 20.87% each), arable land (143 spp., 18.89%) and waste places (122 spp., 16.12%).The majority of plant species found in flowering stage during July and August months (473 spp., 62.48% and 458 spp., 60.5% respectively),while the least ones during January (51 spp., 6.73%) and December (55 spp., 7.26%). Results of CCA showed that total variations in the response data were 1.742 and 71.8% were explained by the explanatory variables. Based on conditional (net) term effects, mean monthly minimum temperature was detected as the most important and significant [pseudo-F 4.3; p(adj) 0.005] towards explaining the variations in the flowering response data. It was followed by wind speed [pseudo-F 2.9; p(adj) 0.0225] and relative humidity [pseudo-F 2; p(adj) 0.04625] variable. Intrestingly, July and August months not only receive maximum rainfall but also majority of species flowered in these months, but CCA results confirmed that rainfall is not important predictor with respect to species flowering response event in the area. It was concluded that the flora of the study area was more influenced by the climatic factors like temperature, wind speed and relative humidity. This Himalayan region is fragile and rapid temperature rise could lead to catastrophies like wiping out of endemic and endangered species, earlier snowmelts and resultant ealier blooming causing invasive species spread, upwards timber-line shift and rapid changes in vegetation composition. This baseline study information could be used to deal these issues and need to have effective regional collaboration of scientific community and policy makers is recommended. 2018, Pakistan Botanical Society.

The variations in traits of physiological adaptation, net primary productivity, carbon partitioning, morphology, and biomass in response to elevated CO2 concentrations (ambient, 600 and 800mol mol1) during one growth cycle were investigated within the open top chamber (OTC) facility in the foothill of the Himalayas, Dehardun, India.

Furthermore, ECs significantly enhanced biomass production (root and shoot), although declined night leaf respiration. Overall, it was summarized that photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, leaf, and soil carbon and biomass increased under ECs rendering the physiological adaptation to the plant.

Biological invasion is one of such concerns. In the present study, we modeled how change in global climate and regional anthropogenic pressure can impact the distribution of invasive Lantana camara in the Upper Ganga valley of the Western Himalaya (India). The forest in the study area was stratified into 1 km2 grid and two 15 m radius plot were located in each of the forest types in the grid, for recording Lantana presence. In total, 2221 plots were sampled covering 22% of forest. We used predictors representing the climate, forest patch size, fire and natural disaster variables for modeling the species distribution using maximum entropy algorithm. We further simulated 12 future landscape scenarios based on the global trends of these parameters. The present speciesenvironment relationship was projected to these future landscape scenarios. Lantana was presently estimated to spread in 231 km2 of the study area. It invaded larger forest patches in the sub-tropical region, and smaller disturbed forest patches in the warm and cold temperate region. Increased distribution of Lantana was projected across all the future scenarios. The study revealed how global climate changes and regional anthropogenic pressure can have a synergistic effect on the expansion of invasive species in the future. It thus questions the efficiency of conducting only regional efforts in absence of global initiative to reduce the greenhouse gases emission.

The present study was conducted to estimate the carbon stocks and their variation with altitudinal gradient in the Lesser Himalayan foothills of Kashmir. The carbon stocks were estimated in different land use categories, namely: closed canopy forests, open forests, disturbed forests, and agricultural lands within the altitudinal range from 900 to 2500 m. The soil carbon content was determined by the WalkleyBlack titration method. The average soil carbon stock was found to be 2.59 kg m2. The average soil carbon stocks in closed canopy forests, open forests, and disturbed forests were 3.39, 2.06, and 2.86 kg m2, respectively. The average soil carbon stock in the agricultural soils was 2.03 kg m2. The carbon stocks showed a significant decreasing trend with the altitudinal gradient with maximum values of 4.13 kg m2 at 9001200 m a.s.l. and minimum value of 1.55 kg m2 at 21002400 m a.s.l. The agricultural soil showed the least carbon content values indicating negative impacts of soil plowing, overgrazing, and soil degradation. Lower carbon values at higher altitudes attest to the immature character of forest stands, as well as to degradation due to immense fuel wood extraction, timber extraction, and harsh climatic conditions.

Their presence indicates a warm and humid tropical environment in the region during the period of Siwalik sedimentation. Considering all records of Calophyllum, it is suggested that Calophyllum was a frequent forest element throughout the period of Siwalik sedimentation during the Neogene (Miocene time). At present, C. polyanthum grows in the eastern Himalaya, but C. inophyllum is totally absent from north-eastern regions suggesting differential adaptability of these taxa to changing ecoclimatic conditions. Distinct climate change in the area, possibly related to the Himalayan Orogeny during MiocenePleistocene times, might have caused the disappearance of C. inophyllum from the entire eastern Himalaya and north-east Indian plains and a move to littoral/coastal and swampy forests of India and other adjoining south-east Asian regions, Polynesia, and the east coast of Africa. The past global distribution of Calophyllum is also discussed, and it is suggested that India may have been its primary centre of origin.

Field-based AGB and AGBC estimates are vital for carbon cycle study and provide inputs for data-deficit regional and global carbon and climate models. In this paper we generated the primary baseline data on tree composition, species richness (SR), AGB and AGBC gathered from nine 10,000 m2 long-term ecological research (LTER) plots in three distinct PFTs {dry mixed (DM), sal mixed (SM) and teak plantation (TP)} within an Indian tropical deciduous forest along Himalayan foothills during 20092012. The functional relationship of PFT structural attributes i.e. SR, density, basal cover, leaf area index and litter fall on AGB was investigated. PCA was applied to study the relationship between PFT microclimate, structural attributes and diversity vs. AGB. A total of 22, 22 and 6 tree species were found in DM, SM and TP PFT, respectively. Shannon's diversity index was highest (2.46) in DM, whereas Simpson's dominance index was maximum (0.85) in TP. AGB (Mg ha1) ranged from 290.82455.99 among all PFTs.

One of the key corridors of Terai Arc Landscape, in the Himalayan foothills of northern India, Kosi River corridor provides crucial linkage between the Jim Corbett Tiger Reserve and the Ramnagar Forest Division. Growing anthropogenic disturbances in the landscape have led to fragmentation of existing wildlife habitats. The changes were mapped using remotely sensed multi-date satellite images (2009 and 2014) in geographic information system. Land Change Modeler was used to predict LULC distribution for 2020 and 2030 using current disturbance scenarios. The predicted map showed that if the current probability of change persists, dense forest would witness a decline of about 8.5 km in area, while area under plantation would occupy 4.31% (27.9 km2) of the total area by 2030. These changes are significant given the fact that the area is under protected area status. The study indicates that manmade obstructions, in the form of construction of resorts, buildings and residential houses, all along the Kosi River are the major reasons for increasing deforestation. Loss in forest cover outside Corbett Tiger Reserve may lead to loss of important connectivity between the core protected ecosystems, breaking the continuity of genetic exchanges amongst spatially isolated wildlife populations.

Systematic sampling on the daily CO2 exchange process and biophysical parameters formed the basis of this investigation. The analyses based on year-round in-situ measurements showed that mean daily net canopy carbon exchange (net primary productivity) of the system (all species in totality) was 11.8 g C m-2 day-1 (41.5 t C ha-1yr-1). All species had almost equal contribution to the system NPP and they were in order of A. conyzoides (14.6 t C ha-1yr-1), B. biternata (13.8 t C ha-1yr-1) and L. camara (13.1 t C ha-1yr-1). Light use efficiency (LUE) exhibited a bimodal trend with peaks in early (Jun - Jul) and post-monsoon (Oct - Nov) season. Mean LUE of L. camara was 20.8 10.9 mmol CO2 mol-1 PAR, while that of A. conyzoides and B. biternata were 24.7 9.9 and 22.8 10.4 mmol CO2 mol-1 PAR, respectively. Maximum net canopy assmilation (Cnar) was observed in the post-monsoon period and minimum in the winter (Dec). 15 - 50% of the Cnar was lost as night-time plant respiration across an annual growth cycle with maximum during winter and minimum in the post-monsoon season.

To infer the potential and limitations of grass phytolith assemblages and indices to reconstruct vegetation vis--vis climate in the Himalayan mountain regions, we analyzed phytolith assemblages from 66 dominant grasses and 153 surface soils from four different forest types along the c. 130-4000 m a.s.l. elevation gradients in the Darjeeling and Arunachal Himalayas. Grass short cell phytolith assemblages from modern grasses show significant variability with rising elevation. To test the reliability of the above observation, phytoliths from the soil samples were subjected to linear discriminant analysis (DA). DA classified 85.3% and 92.3% of the sites to their correct forest zones in the Darjeeling and Arunachal Himalayas respectively. Relative abundance of bilobate, cross, short saddle, plateau saddle, rondel and trapeziform types allow discrimination of the phytolith assemblage along the elevation gradient. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) on the soil phytolith data further revealed their relationships with the climatic variables. Temperature and evapotranspiration were found to be the most influential for differential distribution of grass phytolith assemblages with rising elevation in the eastern Himalayas. We also tested the reliability of phytolith indices (Ic, Iph and Fs) for tracing the dominance of different grass subfamilies in the eastern Himalayas. Ic proved to be most reliable in discriminating C3/C4 grass along the elevation gradient while Iph and Fs proved to be less reliable. We observed that in the monsoon dominated eastern Himalayas, a little adjustment in Ic index may enhance the accuracy of interpretations.

The results show that out of the total vegetated area in Uttarakhand, 2,686.95 km2 (5.69%) showed changes in the vegetation greenness and 73.64% of this change was significant negative trend (browning). While areas with <800 m elevation showed dominant browning, those between 800 and 1600 m showed significant positive trend (greening), and majority of areas >1600 m were characterized by browning trend. Majority of intensively cultivated irrigated croplands in the Himalayan foothills and areas around growing urban centers showed widespread browning, whereas areas of rainfed cultivation showed dominant greening. Browning was also dominant in closed needle leaf forests and alpine shrublands, except areas where human impacts has led to more mixed patterns.

We assessed the diversity and frequency of insect herbivory on 137 specimens representing the Darjeeling lower Siwalik flora (DLSF). We also examined the percent of leaf area removed by herbivory as an independent measure of the effect of insect herbivore removal of host plant photosynthetic tissue. Five functional feeding groups (FFGs) are identified in this study namely leaf mining, hole feeding, skeletonizing, galling and margin feeding. These traces indicate that insects interacted with the plants for various purposes, including feeding, egg laying and sheltering. Furthermore, these morphotraces tend to suggest similarities in insect interactions with leaves of extant plant species such as Persea, Woodfordia, Shorea, Artocarpus, Callicarpa, Albizia, Lagerstroemia etc. On the basis of comparison with extant taxa, possible leaf feeders could have belonged to the insect orders Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. Although the morphology of the phytophagous insects associated with the fossil leaves is unknown, present findings reveal that many modern plant-insect relationships were established by the Miocene time and continue to the present, shaping both the present day flora and fauna. In the present study we compare insect herbivory at DLSF to that of our previously investigated Arunachal lower Siwalik flora and two younger floras from that area. We note a similar range of FFGs and damage types observed among these four fossil floras and conclude that compared to biotic factors climate had little influence in determining the evolution of plant-insect interactions in the eastern Himalayan region. 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier","English","dicotyledon;  evergreen tree;  fossil record;  frequency analysis;  functional group;  herbivory;  host plant;  leaf area;  Miocene;  montane forest;  paleoecology;  plant-insect interaction;  sedimentary rock;  species diversity, Arunachal Pradesh;  Darjeeling;  Himalayas;  India;  India;  Siwalik Hills;  West Bengal, Albizia;  Arthropoda;  Artocarpus;  Coleoptera;  Diptera;  Hexapoda;  Lagerstroemia;  Lepidoptera;  Orthoptera;  Persea;  Shorea;  Woodfordia","00310182","10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.07.019",NA,NA,NA,NA,"191-202","Plant-Arthropod Associations from the Siwalik Forests (Middle Miocene) of Darjeeling Sub-Himalaya, India.","selected",NA,"selected"

Accurate LAI estimates of tropical deciduous forest are required in studies of regional and global change modeling. Tropical deciduous forest due to higher species richness, multiple species association, varied phenophases, irregular stem densities and basal cover, multistoried canopy architecture and different micro-climatic conditions offers dynamism to the understanding of the LAI dynamics of different PFTs in an ecosystem. This investigation reports a new indirect method for measurement of leaf area index (LAI) in a topical moist deciduous forest in Himalayan foothills using LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. We measured the LAI in two seasons (summer; leaf senescence stage and post-monsoon; full green stage) in three (dry miscellaneous, sal mixed and teak plantations) plant functional types (PFT) in Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, India. Ground LAI values ranged between 2.41 and 6.89, 1.17 and 7.71, and 1.92 and 5.19 during post-monsoon season and 1.36-4.49, 0.67-3.1 and 0.37-1.83 during summer season in dry miscellaneous, sal mixed and teak plantation, respectively. We observed strong correlation between LAI and community structural parameters (tree density, basal cover and species richness), with maximum with annual litter fall (R2 > 0.8) and aboveground biomass (AGB) (R2 > 0.75). We provided equations relating LAI with AGB, which can be utilized in future studies for this region and can be reasonably extrapolated to other regions with suitable statistical extrapolations. However, the relations between LAI and other parameters can be further improved with incorporation of data from optimized and seasonal sampling. Our indirect method of LAI estimation using litter fall as a proxy, offers repetitive potential for LAI estimate in other PFTs with relatively time and cost-effective way, thereby generating quicker and reliable data for model run for regional and global change studies. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantitative palaeoclimate estimation using coexistence approach on pollen data and other proxies indicate significant oscillations in precipitation during the late part of MIS 3 (46.4-25.9ka), early and middle part of MIS 2 (25.9-15.6ka), and 5.4 to 3.5ka. Middle to late MIS 3 (ca46.4-31ka.) was characterized by a comparatively low monsoonal activity and slightly higher temperature than that during ca31ka onwards. Simultaneous expansion of deciduous trees and chloridoid grasses also imply a drier and warmer phase. Between 31 and 22.3ka (late MIS 3 to mid-MIS 2), higher precipitation and a slightly cooler temperature led to an increase in evergreen elements over deciduous taxa and wet-loving panicoid grasses over dry-loving chloridoid grasses than earlier. After ca 22.3ka, shrinking of forest cover, expansion of C4 chloridoid grasses, Asteraceae and Cheno-ams in the vegetation with lowering of temperature and precipitation characterized the onset of the LGM which continued till 18.3ka. End of the LGM is manifested by a restoration in the forest cover and in the temperature and precipitation regime. Later, during 5.4 to 4.3ka, a strong monsoonal activity supported a dense moist evergreen forest cover that subsequently declined during 4.3 to 3.5ka. A further increase in deciduous elements and non-arboreals might be a consequence of reduced precipitation and higher temperature during this phase.

Over the last two decades, land transformation related to exploitative land uses is among the main drivers of changing vegetation cover and productivity in western Himalayas. In a region where field based research is challenging due to heterogenous relief and high altitude, quantifying changes in vegetation photosynthetic activity using remote sensing can provide essential information regarding trends in vegetation cover and its linkages with anthropogenic impacts. We conducted seasonal trend analysis (STA) on MODIS NDVI time-series data (2000-2014) over Uttarakhand Himalayas and examined spatio-temporal patterns in vegetation trends and its association with altitudinal gradient and land use land cover (LULC) dynamics. In STA the first step determines the annual mean and seasonal NDVI patterns and the second step analyzes the non-parametric trend in magnitude and timing of the annual mean and seasonal NDVI cycle. To provide insights on the role of changing land use to detected changes in vegetation trend, we linked MODIS derived trends to land transformation processes using multi-temporal high spatial resolution imagery in Google Earth (GE). In total 3286.82km2 (6.9% vegetated area of Uttarakhand) showed significant trend (p&lt;0.01) in mean annual greenness. While areas &lt;800m elevation showed dominant negative trend in mean annual greenness (browning)), those between 800 and 1600m showed mostly positive trend (greening) and majority of areas &gt;1600m were characterized by negative trend in mean annual greenness. Majority of intensively cultivated irrigated croplands in the Himalayan foothills as well as areas around growing urban centers showed widespread browning, which was contrastingly different from rainfed cultivation areas that showed dominant greening trend. Browning trend was observed to be consistent with increasing altitude, particularly in closed needle leaf forests and alpine shrublands, except areas where human impacts has led to more mixed patterns. Trends in the annual seasonal timing of NDVI indicated an earlier green-up for most parts of the Uttarakhand Himalayas. These results highlight fine scale spatial variations in seasonal vegetation trends and are in partial agreement with previous studies that report only increasing brownness detected at broader scale using much coarser spatial resolution time-series. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Elsevier Ltd","English","land cover;  land use;  MODIS;  NDVI;  remote sensing;  seasonal variation;  spatiotemporal analysis;  time series analysis;  trend analysis;  urbanization;  vegetation cover, Himalayas;  India;  Uttarakhand","01436228","10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.10.007",NA,NA,NA,NA,"29-41","Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Trends in Seasonal Vegetation Productivity Across Uttarakhand, Indian Himalayas, 2000-2014.","selected",NA,"selected"

The survival of these ecosystems and wildlife are now threatened by human activities such as timber harvesting, intensive grazing by livestock, tourism, industrialization, and agricultural expansion into forestlands, and, above all, climate change which has led to the invasion of many noxious weeds. The present study aimed to analyze the invasion status of one such noxious weed, lantana (Lantana camara), from the western Himalayan foothills. A total of 122 plant species were recorded as associates from all lantana infested sites comprising 73 shrubs, 39 herbs, five sedges, and three grasses belonging to 47 families. Fabaceae and Asteraceae were found to be the most dominant families growing generously with lantana. Significant site effect was frequently observed than effect due to invasion status. Soil samples were collected and analyzed from highly invaded and moderately invaded areas to see the relationship between soil physicochemical properties and lantana growth. Results of the present study show that factors such as pH, total nitrogen, soil organic carbon, phosphorus, and potassium contents are positively impelling lantana invasion in all the sites.

Effects of climate change on forests depend on ecosystem-specific factors including dimensions of climate (temperature, precipitation, drought, wind etc.). Available information is not sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the ecological, social and economic consequences. The present study assessed shifts in forest cover types of Western Himalayan Eco-region (700-4500 m). 100 randomly selected samples (75 for training and 25 for testing the model), genetic algorithm of rule set parameters and climatic envelopes were used to assess the distribution of five prominent forest cover types (Temperate evergreen, Tropical semi-evergreen, Temperate conifer, Subtropical conifer, and Tropical moist deciduous forests). Modelling was conducted for four different scenarios, current scenario, changed precipitation (8% increase), changed temperature (1. 07C increase), and both changed temperature and precipitation. On increasing precipitation a downward shift in the temperate evergreen and tropical semi-evergreen was observed, while sub-tropical conifer and tropical moist-deciduous forests showed a slight upward shift and temperate conifer showed no shift. On increasing temperature, an upward shift in all forest types was observed except sub-tropical conifer forests without significant changes. When both temperature and precipitation were changed, the actual distribution was maintained and slight upward shift was observed in all the forest types except sub-tropical conifer. It is important to understand the likely impacts of the projected climate change on the forest ecosystems, so that better management and conservation strategies can be adopted for the biodiversity and forest dependent community.

Such contiguity cannot be guaranteed without providing a path or 'a corridor' through forested landscapes that includes natural land cover and undisturbed patches. Incidentally, the Himalayan foothills have greater pressure on these landscapes due to high human dependence for livelihood. This pressure is expected to increase in the coming years altering the potential corridors between PAs. The PA managers need flexible processing, modeling and decision tools to propose a range of acceptable corridors between the PAs and ensure their sustainable health. Such flexible tools can be utilized in future to modify for taking decision to conserve the patches connecting patches and adapt as per changing landscapes. This article describes utility of geospatial modeling tools to assess the status of corridors in light of changing landscapes between Rajaji and Jim Corbett National Park, the two most important PAs in the Himalayan foothills.

The oldest tree confidently crossdated back to 1886, with good sample depth (5 trees) from 1911, which helped date the fire scars in cross-sections collected from three trees. Fire frequency as determined from fire-scar dates was high, with mean and median fire intervals of 3 years from 1938 to 2006. Fires were likely from human ignitions given the prevalence of human land use in the site. Fire scars were generally recorded at false-ring boundaries and likely represent burning during the hot, dry period in May or early June before the onset of monsoon rainfall beginning in mid-June. Although only three fire-scarred trees were sampled, this preliminary assessment shows there is a potential for additional samples from other stands to develop longer-term fire histories to better understand the role of fire in the ecology and management of chir pine throughout its range in the Himalaya region.

This study appraises the changes in soil properties over the course of a year (spring, summer, autumn, winter) for forest, grassland, and arable soils in a typical hilly and mountainous region of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. Soil samples were collected from major land-cover types in the mountain region: natural forest, grassland, and cultivated land (arable). The natural forest served as a control against which changes in soil properties resulting from removal of natural vegetation and cultivation of soil were assessed. Soil samples were collected from depths of 0-15 and 15-30 cm six times during the year and examined for changes in temperature, moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), micronutrients [iron, manganese, copper, and zinc (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, respectively)], and microbial population. Significant differences were found in soil temperature, soil moisture, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and number of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi among the three land-cover types. Soil under cultivation had 4-5 C higher temperature and 3-6% lower moisture than the adjacent soils under grassland and forest. Electrical conductivity (EC) values of forest, grassland, and arable soil were 0.36, 0.30, and 0.31 dS m-1, indicating that soil collected from the forest had 18-20% more EC than the adjacent arable and grassland soils. On average, amounts of Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn in the soil collected from the arable site were 6.6, 5.7, 1.7, and 0.8 mg kg-1, compared with 24.0, 12.1, 3.5, and 1.2 mg kg-1 soil in the forest soil, showing that arable had two to four times less micronutrients than grassland and forest. Populations of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi in the forest were 22.3 (105), 8.2 (105), and 2.5 (103), respectively, while arable land exhibited 8.2 (105), 3.2 (105), and 0.87 (103). Season (temperature) and depth showed significant effects on microbial activity and nutrient concentration, and both decreased significantly in winter and in the subsurface layer of 15-30 cm. Different contents of the parameters among arable, grassland, and forest soils indicated an extractive effect of cultivation and agricultural practices on soil. Natural vegetation appeared to be a main contributor to soil quality as it maintained the moisture content and increased the nutrient status and microbial growth of soil. Therefore, it is important to sustain high-altitude ecosystems and reinstate the degraded lands in the mountain region.

The 13C of cement from Mohand Rao section varies from - 10.5 to - 0.2 with progressive increase in values from 9 to 7.3 Ma indicating gradual change of existing C3 type vegetation to C 4 type vegetation. Post 7.3 Ma, the 13C value is anchored around zero per mil indicating mixed C3-C4 environment with C4 dominating the ecosystem. In Haripur Khol section, the 13C value of EDCC from sandstone indicates presence of both C3 and C4 type of plants with dominance of C4 in the ecosystem, which corroborates the results of our previous study based on carbon isotope ratio of soil carbonates. The oxygen isotope ratio of EDCC from sandstones does not show any systematic variation with time. The 18O values of EDCC from Mohand Rao section ranges from - 8.9 to - 13.6 and in Haripur Khol section, from - 9.9 to - 13.6. At a given stratigraphic level, the average 18O value of EDCC of sandstones is lower (up to 4) compared to the average 18O of soil carbonate from the same or adjacent level (using our earlier published data from Haripur Khol section). The depletion in 18O of EDCC may be due to contribution of contemporary river water infiltrating the groundwater system in the post-monsoon period. Carbon and oxygen isotope ratio of soil carbonate nodules and carbon isotope ratio of associated organic matter from the same nodules were also measured from the Mohand Rao section in a few cases (n = 9). From 9 to 8 Ma, the carbon isotope ratio of soil carbonates varies from - 10.8 to - 7.8 indicating dominance of C3 type vegetation in the flood plain. In contrast, from 5.4 to 4.8 Ma, the 13C ranges from 0.1 to - 4.3 indicating that the vegetation consisted of mixed C3-C4 plants with C4 dominating the ecosystem.

The study focuses on the impact of land-use types on soil quality by measuring the differences in chemical and physical properties at three sites in adjacently located natural forest land (forest), fallow grassland (grass) and arable land (arable). Soil samples from 0-15 and 15-30 cm depth were collected and examined for particle distribution, dry bulk density, organic matter (OM), pH, macro- and micronutrients. Land-use types had a significant effect on primary soil particle distribution. Highest clay content was found in forest and highest sand content in arable. Forest had relatively the highest levels of OM, macro- and micro-nutrients and arable the lowest. Most of the properties of the 0-15 cm surface level of grass were similar to those observed in the 15-30 cm level in forest. Arable exhibited lowest nutrient status and poorest physical conditions, indicating a degrading effect of arable cultivation practices on soil. Grass and arable showed, compared to forest, a 30-60% average increase in bulk density and 26-66% average decrease in OM. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation of OM with available phosphorus and potassium while it had negative correlation with dry bulk density and pH. Natural vegetation appeared to be a main contributor of soil quality as it maintained the organic carbon stock, and increased the nutrient status of soil and is therefore important for sustainable development of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and other similar areas. Furthermore, OM was shown to be an important indicator of soil quality. 2005 Taylor & Francis.",NA,"English",NA,"09064710","10.1080/09064710510008720","3",NA,NA,NA,"221-228","Effects of Different Land-Use Types on Soil Quality in the Hilly Area of Rawalakot Azad Jammu and Kashmir.","unknown",NA,"selected"

It has been observed that the forest tract has been badly abused in past due to high biotic pressure, recurrent fires and heavy resin tapping by French Cup and Lip method. The resin tapping in the said forest has been stopped since 1983. However, the scars of the past injuries have left a permanent mark on these trees, which have over the years and due to recurrent fires lost their viability and have become prone to heavy insect borers infestation. So the immediate cause of current mortality in this area has been found to be the heavy infestation of insect borers. The study showed that these affected trees were severely attacked by four types of insect borers viz. Shpaenoptera aterrima, Cryptorhynchus rufescens, Platypus biformis and Polygrphus longifolia, which badly damaged the bark and bast and girdled the tree.

An even aged mixed plantation in a hexagonal arrangement with varying proportions of the two species around an indicator or test tree was raised. Periodical observations revealed the quantitative changes in tree growth brought about by the serial manipulation of the neighbours of the indicator tree. In all the combinations, Leucaena exhibited profuse height growth, steady diameter increase, dense canopy and a high wood volume. Acacia, with a slow height growth, lesser diameter increase and bushy habit, exhibited suppressed growth, this effect increasing in combinations with an increased number of Leucaena. Such an intensively competitive combination of a fast growing exotic with a slow growing native would enhance the biomass production potential of the area but may eventually result in the elimination of the native trees.

The Himalayan mountains are the youngest, and among the most unstable. The rainfall pattern is determined by the summer monsoon which deposits a considerable amount of rain (often above 2500 mm annually) on the outer ranges. The amount of annual rainfall decreases from east to west, but the contribution of the winter season to the total precipitation increases. Mountains of these dimensions separate the monsoon climate of south Asia from the cold and dry climate of central Asia. In general, a rise of 270 m in elevation corresponds to a fall of 1C in the mean annual temperature up to 1500 m, above which the fall is relatively rapid. Large scale surface removals and cyclic climatic changes influenced the course of vegetational changes through geological time. The Himalayan ranges, which started developing in the beginning of the Cenozoic, earlier supported tropical wet evergreen forests throughout the entire area (presently confined to the eastern part). The Miocene orogeny caused drastic changes in the vegetation, so much so that the existing flora was almost entirely replaced by the modern flora. Almost all the dominant forest species of the Pleistocene continue to maintain their dominant status to the present. Presently the Himalayan ranges encompass Austro-Polynesian, Malayo-Burman, Sino-Tibetan, Euro-Mediterranean, and African elements. While the Euro-Mediterranean affinities are well represented in the western Himalayan region (west of 77E long.), the Chinese and Malesian affinities are evident in the eastern region (east of 84E long.). However, the proportion of endemic taxa is substantial in the entire region. A representation of formation types in relation to climatic factors, viz., rainfall and temperature, indicates that boundaries between the types are not sharp. Formation types often integrate continuously, showing broad overlaps. Climate does not entirely determine the formation type, and the influence of soil, fire, etc., is also substantial. The ombrophilous broad leaf forests located in the submontane belt (&lt; 1000 m) of the eastern region are comparable to the typical tropical rain forests. On the other extreme, communities above 3000 m elevation are similar to sub-alpine and alpine types. From favorable to less favorable environments, as observed with decreasing moisture from east to west, or with decreasing temperature from low to high elevations, the forests become increasingly open, shortstatured and simpler, with little vertical stratification. Ordination of forest stands distributed within 300-2500 m elevations of the central Himalaya, by and large indicates a continuity of communities, with scattered centers of species importance values in the ordination field. Within the above elevational transect, sal (Shorea robusta) and oak (Quercus spp.) forests may be designated as the climax communities, respectively, of warmer and cooler climates. The flora of a part of the central Himalayan region is categorized as therohemigeophytic and that of a part of the western Himalayan region as geochamaephytic. An analysis of population structure over large areas in the central Himalaya, based on density-diameter distribution of trees, suggests that oldgrowth forests are being replaced by even-aged successional forests, dominated by a few species, such as Pinus roxburghii. Paucity of seedlings of climax species, namely Shorea robusta and Quercus spp. over large areas is evident. The Himalayan catchments are subsurface-flow systems and, therefore, are particularly susceptible to landslips and landslides. Loss of water and soil in terms of overflow is insignificant. Studies on recovery processes of forest ecosystems damaged due to shifting cultivation or landslides indicate that the ecosystems can recover quite rapidly, at least in elevations below 2500 m. For example, on a damaged forest site, seedlings of climax species (Quercus leucotrichophora) appeared only 21 years after the landslide. In the central Himalaya, the biomass of a majority of forests (163-787 t ha-1) falls within the range (200-600 t ha-1) given for many mature forests of the world, and the net primary productivity (found in the range of 11.0-27.4 t ha-1 yr-1) is comparable with the range of 20-30 t ha-1 yr-1 given for highly productive communities of favorable environments. In most of the forests of this region, the litter fall values (2.1-3.8 t C ha-1 yr-1) are higher than the mean reported for warm temperate forests (2.7 t C ha-1 yr-1). Of the total litter, the tree leaves account for 54-82% in the Himalayan forests. The rate of decomposition of leaves in some broadleaf species of submontane belt (0.253-0.274% day-1) are comparable with those reported for some tropical rain forest species. Because of the paucity of microorganisms and microarthropods in the forest litter and soil, high initial C:N ratio and high initial lignin content in leaves, the rate of leaf litter decomposition in Pinus roxburghii is markedly slower than in other species of the central Himalaya. The fungal species composition of the leaf litter of Pinus roxburghii is also distinct from those of other species. A greater proportion of nutrients is accumulated in the biomass component of the Himalayan forests than in the temperate forests. Although litter fall is the major route through which nutrients return from biomass to the soil pool, a substantial proportion of the total return is in the form of throughfall and stemflow. Among the dominant species of the central Himalaya, retranslocation of nutrients from the senescing leaves was markedly greater in Pinus roxburghii than in Quercus spp. and Shorea robusta. Consequently, the C:N ratio of leaf litter is markedly higher in Pinus roxburghii than in the other species. Immobilization of nutrients by the decomposers of the litter with high C:N ratio is one of the principal strategies through which Pinus roxburghii invades other forests and holds the site against possible reinvasion by oaks. Observations on the seasonality of various ecosystem functions suggest that Himalayan ecosystems are geared to take maximum advantages of the monsoon period (rainy season). Most of the human population depends on shifting-agriculture in the eastern region and on settled agriculture in the central and western regions. Either of these is essentially a forest-dependent cultivation. Each unit of agronomic energy produced in the settled agriculture entails about seven units of energy from forests. Consequently, forests with reasonable crown cover account for insignificant percentage of the land. Tea plantations and felling of trees for timber, paper pulp, etc., are some of the major commercial activities which adversely affected the Himalayan forests. 1987 The New York Botanical Garden.",NA,"English",NA,"00068101","10.1007/BF02858183","1",NA,NA,NA,"192-80","Forest Vegetation of the Himalaya.","selected",NA,"selected"

Empirical relationships were established between satellite data-derived spectral indices, band reflectance and ground measured foliar N and C using machine learning algorithm (MLA). Performance of MLAs viz. Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were assessed. Using all the independent spectral variables, RF performed better than ANN and SVM in explaining the variation in foliar N and C. RF was further used to optimize the independent variables for identifying the best predictor variables. It was found that foliar N is strongly related to shortwave infrared-1 (SWIR-1) band and Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE).

But, information on how climatic conditions and land uses influence carbon accumulation in the soils on the Himalayan Mountains is not known. This study reports the impact of four climatic conditions (sub-tropical, altitude: 500-1200 m; temperate 1200-2000 m; lower alpine 2000-3000 m; upper alpine, 3000-3500 m) and four land uses (forest, grassland, horticulture, agriculture) on the concentrations and stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) in upper (0-30 cm) and deeper (30-100 cm) soil depths on the western Himalayan Mountains of India. The study also explored the drivers which influenced the SOC stock build up on the mountains. Rainfall and soil moisture showed quadratic relations, whereas temperature declined linearly with the altitude. SOC stock as well as concentration was the highest (101.8 Mg ha(-1) in 0-30 cm, 227.97 Mg ha(-1) in 0-100 cm) in temperate and the lowest in subtropical climate (37 Mg ha(-1) in 0-30 cm, 107.04 Mg ha(-1) in 0-100 cm). Pattern of SOC stock build up across the altitude was: temperate>lower alpine>upper alpine>sub-tropical. SOC stocks in all land uses across the climatic conditions, except agriculture in lower alpine, was higher (0.7 to 41.6\%) in the deeper than upper soil depth. SOC stocks in both the depths showed quadratic relations with soil temperature and soil moisture. Other factors like fine soil particles, land-use factor and altitude influenced positively whereas slope and pH, negatively to the SOC stocks. In all climatic conditions, other than temperate, SOC stocks were greater in natural ecosystems like forests and pastures (112.5 to 247.5 Mg ha(-1)) than agriculture (63 to 120.4 Mg ha(-1)). In temperate climate, SOC stock in agriculture (253.6 Mg ha(-1)) on well formed terraces was a little higher than forest (231.3 Mg ha(-1)) on natural slope. These observations, suggest that land uses on temperate climate may be treated as potential sinks for sequestration of the atmospheric carbon.

Scaling functions were used to convert soil parameters to unit less 0 to I scale. Normalized values of soil parameters were then multiplied by assigned weights based on relative importance and sensitivity analysis of each indicator. Soils were grouped into 1, 2 and 3 depending on overall additive score. A general guideline developed by the USDA-Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) was followed with certain modifications in depth category for estimation of SLTLs.
