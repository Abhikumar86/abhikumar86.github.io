Here we examined vertical distribution metrics (i.e., number of epiphyte individuals and epiphyte species richness) of vascular epiphytes (i.e., orchids and ferns) on two dominant host trees (i.e., Schima wallichii (DC.) Korth. and Quercus lanata Sm.) in sub-tropical forests of Nepal. We sampled a total number of 72 host trees of Q. lanata and S. wallichii from two forest sites: a government protected national park forest and community managed forest. We applied generalized linear mixed models and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests to explain epiphyte diversity by tree architecture (i.e., diameter at breast height, tree height, crown size, number of forks, bark rugosity, bark pH and tree layer), host species and forest management types. After variable selection via multi-model inference technique, we found diameter at breast height to be the most powerful and significant explanatory variable for the number of epiphyte individuals and epiphyte species richness across host tree species, tree layers, and forest management types. Interestingly, epiphyte diversity was on average higher in the community managed forest than in the national park forest, on S. wallichii than on Q. lanata and particularly on the trunk below forks. We conclude that effective conservation of epiphyte diversity in the Nepal Himalaya requires conservation of old-growth host trees through community approaches. If large and old tree stands are maintained, community managed forests can host high diversity of vascular epiphytes and provide ecosystem goods to local people alike. 2021 The Author(s)","Elsevier B.V.","English",NA,"23519894","10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01544",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vascular Epiphyte Diversity and Host Tree Architecture in Two Forest Management Types in the Himalaya.","selected",NA,"excluded"

The assessment of vulnerability of forests in the Indian Western Himalayan (IWH) region comprising the states of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Uttarakhand (UK) was done using six indicators of vulnerability in the form of biological richness index, disturbance index, forest canopy density, fire point intensity and forest extraction intensity of fringe forests. We express this assessment as the indicator-based vulnerability. The indicators were allocated weights by multi criteria analysis using analytical hierarchy process. The spatial extent of all of the selected indicators was mapped for the IWH region at a pixel resolution of 24 m and was integrated to find out the vulnerability for each pixel in a GIS environment. The study area was divided into 172 grids of size 0.5, equivalent to the grid size of available climatic projections, out of which 67 grids were identified as the forest grids. The grids that have at least 5% forest cover were designated as the forest grids and the vulnerability assessment was done only for these grids. The final representation of vulnerability across forested grids of the IWH was done at a spatial resolution of 5' and 0.5 to categorise as low, medium, high and very high class. It was observed that the highest concentration of very high and high vulnerable grids of 5' size lies in the state of UK, comprising 32 and 31%, respectively. The aggregated values at 0.5 indicate that most of the grids of UK fall under very high vulnerability except for the few uppermost and lowermost grids falling under other categories. In J&K, most of the 5' grids fall under low vulnerability (41%), while medium, high and very high categories are 27, 25 and 7%, respectively. Similarly, out of total 28 grids of size 0.5, only one grid is categorized as very high vulnerable, while 11 grids fall under high vulnerability. In HP, none of the grids of either size is categorized as very high vulnerable. It was observed that most of the high and very high vulnerable grids in the IWH are in the lower altitudes while higher altitudes have lesser magnitude of vulnerability. Forests occurring at a higher elevation such as the Alpine forests (dry, moist and sub-alpine) is the least vulnerable forests compared to other forest type groups of the IWH. 2021 The Authors","Elsevier B.V.","English","Deforestation;  Ecosystems;  Extraction;  Fires;  Image resolution;  Pixels;  Sustainable development, Analytical Hierarchy Process;  Disturbance index;  Forest ecosystem;  Forest fires;  Forest resource extraction;  Integrated approach;  Sustainable management;  Vulnerability;  Vulnerability assessments;  Western himalayas, Climate change, alpine environment;  analytical hierarchy process;  environmental disturbance;  forest canopy;  forest cover;  forest ecosystem;  GIS;  pixel;  spatial resolution;  vulnerability, Himachal Pradesh;  Himalayas;  India;  Jammu and Kashmir;  Uttarakhand, Indicator indicator","1470160X","10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107568",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Indicator-Based Vulnerability Assessment of Forest Ecosystem in the Indian Western Himalayas: An Analytical Hierarchy Process Integrated Approach.","selected",NA,"selected"

Effects of climate change on rangeland vegetation likely depend on grazing by herbivores but the potential responses of vegetation to such changes in climate and grazing regimes remain unclear. We examined vegetation responses to experimentally simulated climate change (warming, drought and increased rainfall) and grazing (clipping vegetation) between 2015 and 2018 at two mountain rangeland sites: Spiti valley, in the Indian Trans-Himalaya and Tost, in the Gobi-Altai Mountains in Mongolia. Clipping and climate change manipulations interactively reduced vegetation cover and biomass but did not affect species richness. Treatment effects and their interactions varied between sites. In ungrazed plots, vegetation cover and biomass declined sharply in response to warming (18%35%) and drought (20%50%) at the two sites, and, surprisingly also declined slightly in response to increased rainfall (20%) at Tost. While the effects of climate treatments were largely similar in the grazed and ungrazed plots in Tost, they were larger in the ungrazed plots in Spiti. The decline in vegetation cover was driven by a decline in the cover of both forbs and grasses. In combination, grazing and warming (Tost) or drought (Spiti) had sub-additive effects, that is, the decrease in vegetation cover in response to grazing and warming/drought was less than the sum of their independent effects but greater than the effect of either manipulation alone. Of the two, warming had a greater effect than drought at the more arid site (Tost), whereas drought had a larger effect at the more mesic site (Spiti). Synthesis and applications. Our findings show that future changes in climate, including just over 1C of warming, could undermine the sustainability of pastoral economies and the persistence of wildlife across Asian montane rangelands. Furthermore, grazing by herbivores will play an important role in mediating rangeland responses to climate change; thus, pasture management in concert with local pastoralists will be crucial in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change on rangelands, pastoral livelihoods and wildlife populations. 2020 British Ecological Society","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","English","biomass;  climate change;  detection method;  drought;  grazing;  herb;  mountain region;  rainfall;  rangeland;  sustainability;  vegetation cover;  vegetation type;  wild population, Altai Mountains, Poaceae","00218901","10.1111/1365-2664.13781","3",NA,NA,NA,"539-549","Grazing and Climate Change Have Site-Dependent Interactive Effects on Vegetation in Asian Montane Rangelands.","selected",NA,"excluded"

The country suffers from frequent flooding and is lately experiencing a growing risk of localized droughts due to inappropriate water resource management and climate change. Such a situation calls for much more efficient use and management of water in Bhutan. This paper undertakes an extensive analysis of the countrys water resources for better planning and management of the available water resources. Bhutan can be divided into three zones, the Southern Foothills, the Central Inner Himalayas, and the Higher Himalayas. The top four leading industries of Bhutan are related to water, either directly or indirectly. The country at present is at a very early stage of development. The government has prioritized water resources management over recent years. Water for hydropower in Bhutan has been in focus as compared to that allocated for irrigation, industries, and environmental demand. The demand for water in Bhutan has also increased in the last decade due to population increase, changes in lifestyle, and economic advancements through tourism and hydropower projects. Climate variation, deteriorating water quality, frequent floods, and increasing urbanization threaten the sustainability of water resources. Water accessibility issues for settlements due to the countrys harsh geographical landscape is leading towards localized water scarcity. Serious attention to rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge is required to address localized water scarcity issues. 2021 by the authors.

Samples were analyzed for assessment of physico-chemical properties at four soil depths, viz., 015, 1530, 3045, and 4560 cm. A total of 120 soil samples were collected in both the seasons. Soil texture was found to be sandy loam and slightly alkaline in nature. The relative trend of soil organic carbon (SOC), macro-and micro-nutrient content for the five LUSs was forest > orchard > grassland > wheatrice > sugarcane, in the pre-and post-monsoon seasons. SOC was highly correlated with macronutrients and micronutrients, whereas SOC was negatively correlated with soil pH (r = 0.818). The surface soil layer (015 cm) had a significantly higher content of SOC, and macro-and micro-nutrients compared to the sub-surface soil layers, due to the presence of more organic content in the soil surface layer. Tukeys multiple comparison test was applied to assess significant difference (p <0.05) among the five LUSs at four soil depths in both the seasons. Principle component analysis (PCA) identified that SOC and electrical conductivity (EC) were the most contributing soil indicators among the different land use systems, and that the post-monsoon season had better soil quality compared to the pre-monsoon season. These indicators helped in the assessment of soil health and fertility, and to monitor degraded agroecosystems for future soil conservation. 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, it is vital to understand the role of different forests in regulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of atmospheric CO2 concentration. In this study, we have used eddy covariance (EC) tower-based atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements and satellite-retrieved column average CO2 concentration of 2018 to understand the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of atmospheric CO2 concentration over the sub-tropical forest in the foothills of northwest Himalaya, Uttarakhand, India. EC study revealed that the CO2 concentration over the forest canopy peaks during mid-night to early morning and drop to a minimum during the afternoon. On a monthly scale, peak atmospheric CO2 concentration was observed during July in both the sites, which was a result of more release of CO2 by the forest ecosystem through ecosystem respiration and microbial decomposition. Enhanced photosynthetic activities during the late monsoon and post-monsoon resulted in the decrease of atmospheric CO2 concentration over the forest ecosystem. Among the meteorological variables, rainfall was found to have the highest control over the seasonal variability of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite-retrieved column average CO2 (XCO2) was also examined to comprehend its reliability on an ecosystem scale. The OCO-2 retrieved XCO2 value was higher than the EC carbon flux tower-measured atmospheric CO2 concentration, which might be due to differences in the vertical resolution of the CO2 column and scale difference. However, the monthly atmospheric XCO2 retrieved from OCO-2 strongly adheres with the ground-measured monthly pattern. Our study highlights that forests with varying functional traits within the same climatic conditions show variability in the regulation of atmospheric CO2 concentration. 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Atmospheric thermodynamics;  Dynamics;  Ecosystems;  Forestry;  Greenhouse effect;  Orbits;  Satellites;  Tropics, Ecosystem respiration;  Eddy covariance towers;  Meteorological variables;  Microbial decomposition;  Photosynthetic activity;  Seasonal variability;  Spatio-temporal dynamics;  Subtropical forests, Carbon dioxide, atmospheric pollution;  broad-leaved forest;  carbon cycle;  carbon dioxide;  concentration (composition);  deciduous forest;  eddy covariance;  forest canopy;  greenhouse gas;  NDVI;  seasonal variation;  subtropical region, Himalayas;  India, carbon dioxide, ecosystem;  environmental monitoring;  forest;  India;  reproducibility;  season, Carbon Dioxide;  Ecosystem;  Environmental Monitoring;  Forests;  India;  Reproducibility of Results;  Seasons","01676369","10.1007/s10661-021-08896-4","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Seasonal Dynamics and Impact Factors of Atmospheric Co2 Concentration over Subtropical Forest Canopies: Observation from Eddy Covariance Tower and Oco-2 Satellite in Northwest Himalaya, India.","selected",NA,"selected"

We therefore selected two natural wetlands located at contrasting climatic zones from foothill and mountainside of Nepal Himalayas, to test: (1) whether the optimal temperature for methane emissions decreases from low to high altitude, and (2) whether there is a difference in temperature sensitivity of methane emissions from those wetlands. We found significant spatial and temporal variation of methane emissions between the two wetlands and seasons. Soil temperature was the dominant driver for seasonal variation in methane emissions from both wetlands, though its effect was perplexed by the level of standing water, aquatic plants, and dissolved organic carbon, particularly in the deep water area. When integrative comparison was conducted by adding the existing data from wetlands of diverse altitudes, and the latitude-for-altitude effect was taken into account, we found the baseline soil temperatures decrease whilst the altitude rises with respect to a rapid increase in methane emission from all wetlands, however, remarkably higher sensitivity of methane emissions to soil temperature (apparent Q10) was found in mid-altitude wetland. We provide the first evidence of an apparent decline in optimal temperature for methane emissions with increasing elevation.

Available literature on forestrys dilemmas reveals that, except for the extreme temperature, moisture, and nutrient deficient situations, vegetation can (a) efficiently conserve elevated atmospheric carbon; (b) use the absorbed carbon in biomass production through the process of photosynthesis; and (c) if properly managed, can help to boost gross and net primary productivity of an ecosystem while mitigating global climate change. Within Nepal, conservationists, scientists, and administrators have expressed growing concerns about the rapid deterioration of the Himalayan environment because of deforestation, landslide increases, and large-scale downstream flooding. These processes are frequently linked together into a wide-ranging cause-and-effect drama of the Himalayan Degradation. Effective management of forest resources is considered one of the solutions to ameliorating environmental and land degradations. Recent Nepals government statistics show that Nepals total forest area has increased from 29 to 44%; however, forests are constantly facing new socio-environmental pressures from the growing population and from bulldozer-based development. Further complicating this issue, the statistics on Nepals forests have been disputed by various scholars. Nonetheless, through a set of policies, Nepal has been actively involved in the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, Plus Related Pro-forest Activities) programs since 2009 involving local communities to conserve and manage existing forests and creating new forest on non-forested lands through afforestation programs. If applied effectively, the full range of REDD+ activities can turn forests from a source of global warming emissions into a counteracting sink. REDD+s incentives in the form of carbon fund allocations and can act as a development catalyzer, involving many communities in greening the denuded lands of Nepal while also generating employment opportunities at local grass-root levels. Government agencies, many private organizations, religious institutions, and over 22,266 community forestry user groups have been involved in the management of Nepals forests, and their activities are contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions through forest conservation as well as deriving economic benefits to local communities. Though mountainous Nepal contributes merely 0.027% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions, it unwillingly exports top fertile soils along the rivers flowing down steep to very steep gradients. Sedimentation from Nepals Himalayan region often clogs rivers and canals along the Indo-Gangetic belt and causes massive floods in the Indian state of Bihar before draining into the Bay of Bengal. Participatory natural resource management and the ecosystem services concept proposed in this chapterwhich have been instrumental across many South Asian, European, and North American countries in claiming degraded lands and mutually benefitting the upstream and downstream communitiescould be instrumental in the restoration and management of degraded ecosystems in various parts of Nepal. We propose such a concept to solve the ongoing problems of land degradation of the Churia Range of Nepal. We have divided the entire Churia and corresponding Tarai-Madhesh regions into 91 watersheds and recast them as the operational service providing units (SPUs) for handling this deforestation dilemma. There are several sub-SPUs within SPUs, serving local communities. It is hoped that with the delineation of SPUs and sub-SPUs, it will be possible to make individual households living within the watersheds responsible for managing their lands and forest resources of their territories and creating an environment of communalism where both upstream and downstream communities will benefit in this win-win environmental scenario. The woodlots and vegetated areas that the households living within SPU and sub-SPUs manage will provide a wide range of ecosystem services to the downstream communities. In turn, the upstream communities will benefit from the downstream communities and REDD+s incentives programs while also ameliorating the global climate from carbon sequestration. The upstream communities benefit from grant money or development funds granted from the government. The government might increase nominal revenue on the farmlands of downstream communities for the regulated ecosystem services from upstream communities. Revenues paid to the government by the downstream communities can be redirected as the government grants money to upstream communities to further improve the ecosystem services to the downstream communities. Properly identifying, assessing, and valuing natural resources and ecosystem services within SPUs and sub-SPUs will help in the management of natural resources in various ways. One such approach proposed here is the prioritization of SPUs management options by assessing the trade-offs in ecosystem services and developing resilient communities who will eventually contribute to the sustainable management of available resources while contributing to the mitigation of global climate changes. Different computer-based models along with this chapter will help local communities to assess their benefits from each SPU or sub-SPU and change their course of actions in the future. 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","English",NA,"18797180","10.1007/978-3-030-50168-6_8",NA,NA,NA,NA,"663-754","Forestry and Environment.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

The current study aimed to classify the vegetation along theRiver Panjkora of thedistrict Dir Lower, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan into different phytogeographic units via exercising the Multivariate statistical techniques. Vegetation sampling was carried out through quadrat quantitative ecological techniques. Quadrats of various sizes i.e. 1 1m2, 5 5m2 and 10 10m2 were taken for herbs, shrubs and trees, respectively. Inclusively 215 plant species belong to 22 different phytogeographic elements were analysed anddocumented. The most dominant category ofphytogeographic element wasIrano-Turanian with 77 species, followed by Cosmopolitan 25 species, Holarctic 23 species, Pluriregional 19 species, Mediterranean 16 species, Western Himalayan 14 species, Paleotropical 12 species andEastern Asiatic 6 species. Eurasian, Euro-Siberian and Saharo-Arabian wererepresented by 3 species, Tropical, Sub-cosmopolitan and Pantropical contribute by2 species while Paleo-temperate, South American, Australian, American, African and central Asian element by a single species. The relationship of various phytogeographic elements with different environmental variables such as pH, EC, TDS, Mn, Ni, Co, Cr, Cu, Cd, Zn, Fe, Na, Ca, Mg and K were determined via Canonical and Detrended Correspondence Analyses. We have observed that with the increase in nutrients concentration i.e., Mn, Co, Mg &amp; Ni thenumber of Irano-Turanian, Cosmopolitan, Holarctic, Mediterranean &amp; Western Himalayan elements increases while with the decrease in nutrients Cr, Cu, Cd and Na concentration the number of Australian, Sub-Cosmopolitan, Sahro-Arabian, Euro-Siberian, Tropical, American, and Pantropical phytogeographical elements decreases.

Conventional techniques generally focus on per-pixel based processing and overlook the sub-pixel variations occurring especially in case of low or moderate resolution remotely sensed data. However, the existing subpixel-based change detection (SCD) models are less effective to detect the mixed pixel information at its complexity level especially over rugged terrain regions. To overcome such issues, a topographically controlled SCD model has been proposed which is an improved version of widely used per-pixel based change vector analysis (CVA) and hence, named as a subpixel-based change vector analysis (SCVA). This study has been conducted over a part of the Western Himalayas using the advanced wide-field sensor (AWiFS) and Landsat-8 datasets. To check the effectiveness of the proposed SCVA, the cross-validation of the results has been done with the existing neural network-based SCD (NN-SCD) and per-pixel based models such as fuzzy-based CVA (FCVA) and post-classification comparison (PCC). The results have shown that SCVA offered robust performance (85.6%86.4%) as compared to NN-SCD (81.6%82.4%), PCC (79.2%80.4%), and FCVA (81.2%83.6%). We concluded that SCVA helps in reducing the detection of spurious pixels and improve the efficacy of generating change maps.

The climatic conditions range from temperate to tropical thus making India suitable for a wide range of fruit diversity. The diversity in underutilized and lesser known edible fruit types belongs to 45 families, 106 genera and 261 species. The Himalayan region has a different wealth of wild fruit plants than the peninsular tropical-sub-tropical parts of the country. Some important genera of temperate Himalayan belt are Docynia, Ribes, Pyrus, Sorbus, Hippophae, Berberis, Cornus, Rubus, Fragaria, Crataegus, Viburnum and Vaccinium. The common wild fruits are species of Capparis, Grewia, Zizyphus, Rhus, Carissa, Flacourtia and Salvadora in the arid/semi-arid tracts of northern India. In the humid areas of Western Ghats, parts of Eastern Ghats and the north-eastern hills, the wild fruits belong to the genera Solanum, Garcinia, Elaeocarpus, Citrus, Elaeagnus, Mangifera, Syzygium and Vitis. Underutilized fruits contribute toward the food security, nutritional/medicinal health benefits and income generation in the local areas, but have largely remained underexploited and neglected. There are species whose ripe fruits are eaten raw or processed e.g. Aegle marmelos (Rutaceae), Artocarpus lakoocha (Moraceae), Zizyphus nummularia (Rhamnaceae) etc. while unripe fruits of species like Artocarpus heterophyllus (Moraceae), Carissa carandas (Apocynaceae), Emblica officinalis (Euphorbiaceae) are used as vegetable or pickles. Some species are used as scarcity or famine foods e.g. Ficus spp. (Moraceae), Physalis minima (Solanaceae), Prosopis cineraria (Fabaceae). With the changing climate in the country especially in the temperate regions, the wild species are getting lost mainly due to insufficient chilling. Conservation of wild species and domesticated diversity is immensely important. Not only do they provide livelihood to the local people but may have genes for abiotic and biotic potential for use in future breeding program.

Although the high mountain natural forests including treelines in the Himalayan region are mainly reported to be temperature sensitive, the temperature-related water stress in an important growth-limiting factor for middle elevation mountains. And there are very few evidences on growth performance of planted forest in changing climate in the Himalayan region. A dendrochronological study was carried out to verify and record the impact of warming temperature tree growth by using the tree cores of Pinus roxburghii from Batase village of Dhulikhel in Central Nepal with sub-tropical climatic zone. For this total, 29 tree cores from 25 trees of P. roxburghii were measured and analyzed. Result: A 44-year long tree ring width chronology was constructed from the cores. The result showed that the radial growth of P. roxburghii was positively correlated with pre-monsoon (April) rainfall, although the correlation was not significant and negatively correlated with summer rainfall. The strongest negative correlation was found between radial growth and rainfall of June followed by the rainfall of January. Also, the radial growth showed significant positive correlation with that previous year August mean temperature and maximum temperature, and significant negative correlation between radial growth and maximum temperature (Tmax) of May and of spring season (March-May), indicating moisture as the key factor for radial growth. Despite the overall positive trend in the basal area increment (BAI), we have found the abrupt decline between 1995 and 2005 AD. Conclusion: The results indicated that chir pine planted population was moisture sensitive, and the negative impact of higher temperature during early growth season (March-May) was clearly seen on the radial growth. We emphasize that the forest would experience further moisture stress if the trend of warming temperatures continues. The unusual decreasing BAI trend might be associated with forest management processes including resin collection and other disturbances. Our results showed that the planted pine forest stand is sub-healthy due to major human intervention at times.

However, the CO2 carbon exchange characteristics (Gross Primary Productivity, Net Ecosystem Exchange, and Ecosystem respiration) of Indian forests are poorly understood. Immense carbon sequestration opportunities exist with the natural as well as planted forests. Therefore, it becomes vital to assess the potential of existing forests (natural and planted) by means of the most accurate and reliable methods of eddy covariance (EC). It is also important to know the eco-physiological response of the forests towards diurnal, seasonal, and yearly changes in the prevailing environmental conditions. We analyzed CO2 carbon exchange characteristics of a mature moist deciduous forest and a young mixed deciduous plantation located in the sub-tropical climate regime in the western Himalayan foothills of India with the help of co-located EC measurements (2016 to 2018). The study reveals that both the mature forest ( 719.43 gCm 2year 1) and young plantation ( 467.49 gC m 2 year 1) are absorbing a significant amount of atmospheric CO2 carbon. The maximum uptake of atmospheric CO2 occurred during the post-monsoon season in both the forests. The minimum NEE of the mixed deciduous plantation was observed during the leaf fall period while the NEE of the moist deciduous forest was the lowest in monsoon due to a higher respiration rate during monsoon. Among the environmental factors, soil moisture showed maximum control on the productivity of both the forest ecosystems.

Biomass and primary productivity are the crucial dynamic biophysical parameters for understanding the ecosystem functioning in any forested landscape. The present study was performed in Aglar watershed situated in outer Indian Himalayan range. We performed geospatial modeling of plot-level field data on forest above ground biomass (AGB) by correlating it with textural, spectral and linearly transformed variables retrieved from Landsat 8 OLI data using of random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. We also applied recursive feature elimination function (RFE) to obtain the variables contributing most in AGB prediction. A combination of 24 among 96 variables was identified as the most effective variables. Ground-based AGB varied from 62.54 to 470.98Mgha1, whereas RF-modeled AGB ranged from 48.5 to 407.73Mgha1. Results indicated that RFE selected variables were able to predict AGB with R2 of 0.84, RMSE of 42.03Mgha1, MAE of 34.68 and %RMSE of 19.49Mgha1 which was accepted considering the terrain complexity.

With palmately lobed rhizome and lanceolate leaves having a sheathing leaf base, it bears pink flowers with purple-colored notches and a curved spur. It finds wide use in ayurveda, siddha, unani, and folk medicine in curing disorders of the circulatory, respiratory, nervous, digestive, skeletal, and reproductive systems, besides boosting the immune system to fight infectious diseases. Secondary metabolites such as dactylorhins AE, dactyloses AB, and others exhibit a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities (antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiseptic, anticancer, and immune enhancing activities). Its use as a dietary supplement was found to be beneficial in increasing testosterone levels, resulting in improved sexual desire and arousal. Incessant overexploitation of this medicinally important herb has resulted in the dwindling of its populations in the wild, which has resulted in its classification as a critically endangered plant species. Efforts involving mass reproduction through in vitro (through tissue culture) and in vivo (by vegetative propagation) means are currently being made to maintain the germplasm of this critically endangered orchid. Holding immense significance in clinical research and drug discovery, work on the genomic front (transcriptomics) has recently been carried out to discover the wealth of unexplored genetic information for this perennial herb. The present study is aimed at reviewing different aspects of the orchid to present collective (summarized) information on this medicinally important herb in the present, particularly its botany, ethnobotanical uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacognosy, along with the strategies that need to be adopted to prevent its overexploitation in natural habitats. 2020 by the authors.

Since habitat type is a good predictor of success of biological invasion at local scale, we studied distribution and abundance of native and alien plant species in eight habitat types namely lakes, wetlands, riparian, roadsides, orchards, grasslands, scrubs, and forests (06 sites each giving a total of 48 sites). For estimating taxonomic homogenization index, we calculated Jaccards similarity index separately for native, alien and alien + native species. We also calculated functional , , and diversity for three functional traits in three different ways i.e. with all species included, with only native species included and with only alien species included. We observed that habitats differ with respect to functional and floristic diversity. Aquatic habitats (species poor) were found to be more homogenous (average A = 0.58) than terrestrial habitats (average A = 0.68) with man-managed habitats (orchards) being taxonomically (average A = 0.59) and functionally (FA = 0.04) most homogenous among terrestrial habitats.

However, the physical attributes of paleosols subjected to burial cannot be used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. In contrast, selective pedogenic tracers such as rare earth (REE) and trace elements, and organic proxies such as pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios, and D/H and 13C/12C ratios of n-alkanes that are resistant to post-depositional processes can provide insight into pedogenic conditions. Although the upper Miocene Siwalik paleosols from the Himalayan Foreland Basin (HFB) have been used for past vegetation and climate reconstructions, little emphasis has been given to understand their formation. In this regard, the Jabbarkhad Siwaliks of the Kangra sub-basin, identified as distal alluvial fan deposits with records of temporal variability in rainfall and vegetation composition, have been used to investigate the combined impact of depositional environment, topography, climate and vegetation composition on paleosol formation. Prominent negative Eu-anomalies in CI-normalised REE patterns along with uniform ratios of refractory elements suggest a dominant and consistent source of sediments from K-rich granitic upper continental crust. A wide variation in the abundance of REE indicates the modification of sediments by pedogenetic processes. In the Jabbarkhad region, oxic (higher Pr/Ph) and well-drained soils favoured the proliferation of grasses. The high root density and organic turnover of grasses facilitated the development of a mature, strongly leached soil (high Ba/Sr) under high rainfall and humid conditions (lower 2 values). Less mature (lower Ba/Sr) paleosols were developed in low-lying anoxic (Pr/Ph &lt;1) floodplain areas dominated by C3 trees near the active channel. Comparison of soil maturity from the Gangetic floodplain, a modern analogue of the Siwalik sediments, suggests that the spatial variability of paleosol maturity was controlled by the landscape mosaic of the Siwalik floodplain. Since pedogenesis and vegetation distribution are controlled by floodplain morphology, sampling of paleosols with similar pedogenic and geomorphic characteristics is essential for evaluation of vegetation distribution in temporally separated paleosols. 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","English","alluvial fan;  foreland basin;  Miocene;  monsoon;  paleoclimate;  paleosol;  pedogenesis;  rare earth element;  sediment analysis;  trace element;  tracer;  vegetation structure, Gangetic Plain;  Himachal Pradesh;  Himalayas;  India;  Kangra;  Siwalik Hills, Poaceae","00310182","10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109854",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Impact of Monsoon, Vegetation, and Landscape on Pedogenesis: a Case Study using Organic and Inorganic Tracers from the Himalayan Foreland Sediments.","selected",NA,"selected"

Considering this, the present study has been undertaken in the Himachal Pradesh state in north India. It aims to provide detailed information on diversity, distribution, use pattern, and conservation status of selected NTFPs that have market potential, and suggest a possible way for their sustained management and possible role in livelihood upgradation of dependent communities. Methodology: An inventory of NTFP species was prepared by collecting secondary information from published scientific studies in journals, books, and other periodicals as well as species being traded as per Forest department records. Search on various online databases were also used (Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, ISI Web of Science) using specific search terms such as ""non-timber forest products,""""NTFPs,""""medicinal plants,""""wild edible plants,""and ""Himachal Pradesh,""""Western Himalaya,""and ""Northwest Himalaya.""A list of potential NTFPs was prepared having market value. To evaluate the relative usefulness of different species, a quantitative valuation was also used by calculating various indices, such as use value (UV), relative frequency of citation (RFC), relative importance index (RI), cultural importance index (CI), and cultural value (CV). Results: A total of 811 species have been screened that has significant potential for the State, and categorized in 18 groups as per their use. The family use value was highest for Asteraceae (FUV = 76.75). Among plant parts used, whole plants, roots (including rhizomes and tubers), leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and barks were used by the forest dwellers. Maximum NTFPs were collected from the warm temperate zone, followed by the temperate, sub-alpine, sub-tropical, and alpine zones. Sixty-one percent of species had medicinal importance, followed by species used for food and fodder purposes. Although species richness of medicinal plants decreased with altitude, however, most plants extracted from high altitudes were high-value species fetching better income. As many as 125 NTFPs were identified under the diverse level of threats according to IUCN criteria and as per the local stakeholders' perceptions. Conclusion: High dependence on NTFPs by poor and marginal communities for domestic needs as well as market demand of selected species leads to create excessive pressure on them. Unfortunately, the state agencies are not having any robust conservation plan for NTFPs. For long-term management of NTFPs sector, a species-specific conservation strategy, proper harvesting protocol, cultivation practices, the supply of quality planting material, product development and diversification, value chain development, and ensured market is greatly desired. This will not only lead to conserving NTFPs resources in their natural habitats but also lead a sustainable livelihood generation for forest dwellers. 2020 The Author(s).","BioMed Central Ltd","English","altitude;  animal food;  Asteraceae;  cultural value;  edible plant;  flower;  forest;  fruit;  habitat;  Himachal Pradesh;  human;  International Union for Conservation of Nature;  medicinal plant;  Medline;  nonhuman;  perception;  plant leaf;  plant root;  plant seed;  plant stem;  product development;  quantitative analysis;  review;  rhizome;  Scopus;  species richness;  systematic review;  Web of Science;  cultural anthropology;  edible plant;  environmental protection;  ethnobotany;  India;  medicinal plant, Conservation of Natural Resources;  Culture;  Ethnobotany;  Forests;  India;  Plants, Edible;  Plants, Medicinal","17464269","10.1186/s13002-020-00405-0","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Richness of Non-Timber Forest Products in Himalayan Communities - Diversity, Distribution, Use Pattern and Conservation Status.","selected",NA,"excluded"

Here, based on available distribution records, we explored the elevational pattern of species richness for seed plants in the Mt. Namjagbarwa region (Eastern Himalayas, China), a previously unexplored region. Species richness in each 100 m elevation band was estimated by spatial interpolation method according to their recorded elevation range over a large altitudinal gradient from 700 to 5000 m. In each elevation band, species richness was related to several explanatory factors, including temperature, humidity, spatially related variables and biogeographical distributions. Regression analyses were performed to obtain a quantitative assessment of the relative contribution of each predictor to the empirical richness pattern. Overall, species richness along elevation showed a hump-shaped pattern, with a peak at 16002000 m. In all sub-groups (life form, biogeographical affinity, and range-size category), species richness showed unimodal patterns with increasing elevation generally, but with different peak positions. Regression models indicated species richness patterns are highly correlated with energy-related factor in most data sets, explaining the observed richness patterns, but also more or less associated with other variables (climatic variation, area, precipitation, and mid-domain effect). The water-energy dynamics model was found to explain the elevational species richness patterns. Meantime, there was an elevational coincidence between maximum species richness and floristic overlap index, which proving the role of the biotic process in shaping the species richness gradient.

Ox-bow lakes i.e. natural wetlands are the abandoned part of the former meander are common features developed in floodplain. The northern portion of Coochbehar district is under the Tarai belt and the southern portion lies under the alluvial plain physiographic region. The Tarai zone is composed of alternate layers of clay and sand, with a high water table that creates many wetlands. Many natural wetlands in the form of ox-bow lakes have been formed in Tufanganj C.D. Blocks which are locally known as beel or baor. These beels are the abandoned channels of Raidak I, Gadadhar, Kaljani, and Mora Raidak River. Due to the geological and geomorphological set up of this region the rivers mentioned above frequently change their course. Topographical, Geomorphological and Geohydrological maps have been used to know the spatial distribution of wetlands and physiographic set up of the region. Many beels have evolved which are ecologically very much productive. With the help of the Oakton multi parameter and WTW DO meter wetland index has been prepared in some of the beels to analyze the physico-chemical properties of wetlands and to assess the ecological importance as well as human intervention. Thermal bands of Landsat image (OLI/TIRS) have also been used to assess the temperature distribution of the land and wetlands.

While the early-Holocene rainfall records are available from lowland areas of the Indian sub-continent, the record is poorly documented from the high-altitude Central Himalayan region where orography plays an important role in the spatial variability in the rainfall pattern. For the first time, DC29, 13CC29 values of alkane and 13C values of organic matter from a relict lake of Benital area in the Central Himalaya have been used to reconstruct monsoonal rainfall and contemporary vegetation for last 10.5 ka with an emphasis on the early Holocene. The DC29 values suggest that the early Holocene was characterized by a wet phase at ca. 9 ka with 25% higher rainfall compared to present while the middle-late-Holocene was relatively arid. The estimated increase in monsoonal rainfall for the early Holocene is the highest compared to the previous report from elsewhere. The magnitude of early-Holocene rainfall estimated in this study suggests that in addition to erosion of the bed-rocks at the head-water region, increased stream power reworked the older floodplain and resulted in 2.3 times higher sediment discharged into the Ganges-Brahmaputra (GB) delta compared to the present discharge. The 13CC29 values of the lake sediments suggest a transition from woody to non-woody plant assemblages occurred at 7 ka. The poor correlation between DC29 and 13CC29 values suggests at higher rainfall, the 13CC29 values of catchment vegetation were less responsive.

The phenological events of these species were recorded in order to determine the relationship between environmental factors (temperature and precipitation) and phonological events. The main branches and sub-branches of individuals of each species were randomly selected and marked with metal tags to represent the whole canopy from January, 2017 to December, 2018. The data was analyzed with the help of circular statistics and Spearman's rank correlation. The result showed that leaf bud initiation start from February and peaks in May. Young leaves start expanded in April and peaks in July, whereas leaf senescence starts in August. Leaf fall starts from September and peaks in November. Flower/flowering bud starts from February to March and turns into flower in April. Ripening of fruits starts from April and peaks in May while fruit fall occurs in May and peaks in June. It is concluded that environmental factors play important role in timing and recurring of phenophase events in all the species.

From a conservation perspective it is necessary to assess the ecological requirements of woodpeckers in these biologically diverse landscapes, which are experiencing habitat modification and decline in some woodpeckers. We studied the foraging niche differentiation among ten sympatric woodpeckers in the sub-Himalayan forests of northwest India: Dendrocopos canicapillus, D. macei, Picus chlorolophus, P. xanthopygaeus, P. canus, Dinopium shorii, D. benghalense, Chrysophlegma [Picus] flavinucha, Chrysocolaptes lucidus, and Mulleripicus pulverulentus. We examined the foraging site preferences of individual woodpecker species and explored the role of inter-specific differences in foraging behaviour as a possible mechanism for their coexistence. Observations on foraging woodpeckers were taken vis-a-vis the following niche dimensions: Diameter of the foraging tree, height of the foraging bird, type of substrate on which it was foraging, vertical position with respect to canopy, condition of the forage tree and condition of the substrate. Distinct preferences were evident among species in their foraging tree diameters, foraging heights, vertical positions, and choice of substrate type, while preference for dead substrates was not an important distinguishing factor. Species that overlapped in one dimension generally segregated along other dimensions. Niche segregation in forage tree diameter was associated with body weight. Based on their overall niche overlaps species could broadly be differentiated into groups according to body size viz. small (3 species), medium (3 species), large (3 species), and very large (1 species). Our study demonstrates that differentiation in foraging may be a likely mechanism for coexistence of sympatric woodpeckers in this region. Given that larger species prefer larger substrates, removal of mature trees could affect their abundance, and homogenisation of stand structure could lead to impoverishment of woodpecker diversity. 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

Environmental variables directly affect species composition, growth patterns, and the ecosystem resulting in a drastic change in the vegetation composition along ascending elevations. The present study investigated vegetation composition, nestedness, and turnover in plant communities along a vertical gradient (2000 to 4000 m) in Dhauladhar Mountains, Lesser Himalayas, India. We determined how -diversity pattern and nestedness-related processes or turnover (-diversity) causes dissimilarity in plant communities' composition along the vertical gradient. Overall, 21 permanent plots (20 20 m2) at every 100 m interval from 2000 to 4000 m were established. A sampling of shrubs and herbaceous species was done by marking sub-plots of 5 5 m2 and 1 1 m2, respectively, within permanent plots. We observed an inverted hump-shaped pattern for evenness index (E), a unimodal hump-shaped pattern for Shannon index (H), Margalef's richness index, and -Whittaker (w) diversity, and mild-hump-shaped pattern for Simpson index () across the elevational gradient. Turnover (sim) and the nestedness-resultant component of -diversity (sne) significantly differed across the elevational gradient. The observed -diversity patterns revealed that the species replacement rate was less in the mid-altitude communities as compared to lower and higher altitude communities. It was largely attributed to the ecotonic nature of mid-altitudes, which benefited mid-elevational communities rather than low or high altitude communities. Besides lower altitudes, the increased human interference has led to disturbance and subsequent homogenization of flora across the mid-altitudes. With respect to this, the present study signifies the need for preserving the mid-altitudinal communities, without undermining the importance of conserving the low and high altitude communities. 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","English","Biodiversity;  Vegetation, Mid-altitudes;  Nestedness;  Replacement rates;  Richness;  Turnover rate, Landforms, biodiversity;  community composition;  herb;  midlatitude environment;  nestedness;  plant community;  species diversity;  species richness, altitude;  article;  flora;  human;  India;  plant community;  turnover rate;  vegetation;  altitude;  ecosystem;  India;  plant, Himalayas;  Lesser Himalayas, Altitude;  Ecosystem;  India;  Plants","00489697","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136919",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Patterns of Plant Communities along Vertical Gradient in Dhauladhar Mountains in Lesser Himalayas in North-Western India.","selected",NA,"excluded"

In addition, climate change is thought to exacerbate the situation by allowing range expansion of invasive species into new areas. Predicting the distribution of invasive species under conditions of climate change is important for identifying susceptible areas of invasion and developing strategies for limiting their expansion. We used Maxent modeling to predict the distribution of one of the world's most aggressive invasive weeds, Ageratina adenophora (Sprengel) R. King and H. Robinson, in the Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape (CHAL) of Nepal under current conditions and 3 future climate change trajectories based on 3 representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) in 2 different time periods (2050 and 2070) using species occurrence data, and bioclimatic and topographic variables. Minimum temperature in the coldest month was the most important variable affecting the distribution of A. adenophora. About 38% (12,215 km2) of the CHAL area is climatically suitable for A. adenophora, with the Middle Mountain physiographic region being the most suitable one. A predicted increase in current suitable areas ranges from 1 to 2% under future climate scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). All protected areas and 3 physiographic regions (Siwaliks, High Mountain, High Himalaya) are likely to gain climatically suitable areas in future climate scenarios. The upper elevational distribution limit of the weed is expected to expand by 31-48 m in future climate scenarios, suggesting that the weed will colonize additional areas at higher elevations in the future. In conclusion, our results showed that a vast area of CHAL is climatically suitable for A. adenophora. Expected further range expansion and upslope migration in the future make it essential to initiate effective management measures to prevent further negative impacts of this invasive plant.","International Mountain Society","English","future prospect;  invasive species;  prediction;  spatial distribution;  weed, Annapurna Conservation Area;  Chitwan;  Gandaki;  Narayani;  Nepal, Adenophora;  Ageratina adenophora","02764741","10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-19-00069.1","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Predicting the Current and Future Distribution of the Invasive Weed Ageratina Adenophora in the Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape, Nepal.","selected",NA,"excluded"

Soil microbial communities compete for nutrient and space and form mutualistic associations with host plants. Rhizosphere, the connecting site of plant roots with soil, influences the soil health and plant-microbe interactions. Soil enzyme activity, which is considered to be the biological indicator of soil health, is significantly influenced by microbial functioning. Betula utilis D. Don is a dominant treeline forming species that has been extensively studied for the impact of climate-mediated variations in sub-alpine Himalayan region. However, the microbial ecology of this species remains almost unexplored. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the endophytic communities associated with B. utilis roots along with the status of enzymes, nutrients, and microbial communities in rhizosphere soil in two seasons from three sites in North-Western Himalaya. Activity of soil enzymes (acid and alkaline phosphatase, aryl sulfatase, -glucosidase, urease and dehydrogenase) varied statistically with respect to seasons. Except dehydrogenase, the soil enzymes activity correlated with pH, organic carbon, and phosphorus content in soil. High dehydrogenase activity is attributed to high microbial activity in dormant season. B. utilis roots were found to be colonized with a range of microbial communities namely, mycorrhizae, dark septate endophytes (DSE), bacterial endophytes and unidentified nematode like structures (NLS). While, in general, DSE colonization was higher during growing season, mycorrhizae dominated the roots during dormant season. Significant differences were obtained only in mycorrhizal colonization with respect to seasons and sites. Further, significant correlations were obtained among soil nutrients, enzyme activity, and microbial counts during growing season.

PM2.5 was collected daily (24h, once a week) over a year to assess monthly and seasonal variations in NPOC concentration and their source(s) activity. Samples were analyzed on thermal desorption-gas chromatography mass spectrometry to identify and quantify source-specific organic markers. Homologous series of n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), isoprenoid hydrocarbons and nicotine were investigated to understand the sources of aerosols in the region. The annual mean concentration of PM2.5 during the sampling period was found higher than the permissible limit of Indias National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. The rise of concentration for PM2.5 and associated NPOCs in summer season was attributed to enhanced emission. The n-alkane-based diagnostic parameters indicated mixed contributions of NPOCs from anthropogenic sources like fossil fuel-related combustion with significant inputs from biogenic emission. Moreover, high influence of petrogenic contributionwas observed in summer (monsoon) months. The quantifiable amounts of isoprenoid hydrocarbons further confirmed this observation. Total PAH concentration also followed an increasing trend from March to June, and June onwards a sharp decrease was observed. The higher concentration of environmental tobacco smoke marker nicotine in winter months was plausibly due to lower air temperature and conditions unfavourable to photo-degradation. A clear dominance of low molecular weight PAHs was noticed with rare presence of toxic PAHs in the ambient atmosphere of Jammu.

The estimates of quantile model show that operational land holding, extension contact, family type, house type and farm assets had significant influence on intensity of adoption. Besides, findings of SUR model identified PB-1121 of rice and HD-2967 of wheat the best suitable varieties.

The influential factors leading to higher erosion rates were studied under variable scenarios of environmental change. The study revealed an average soil loss of about 8.4tons/ha/year in the study area. The intensity of erosion was predicted around 15tons/ha/year in the open soil and 10.3tons/ha/year in the agriculture land. The rate of erosion was found maximum over 515 slope, i.e., about 19tons/ha/year. At steeper slopes (i.e., > 15), the lower values of erosion rates were observed likely because of presence of exposed rocks lacking extensive soil cover. High risk of erosion was predicted in scenarios of increase in rainfall and conversion of rangeland and scrub forest into agriculture land in the basin.

The present study was carried out in an urban sub-basin of lesser Himalayas, India, to appraise the spatial variability of soil textural fractions (sand, silt, and clay), bulk density (b), porosity () and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks). Using the Global positioning system (GPS) soil samples from 100 randomly selected locations were collected at an average depth of 25 cm under different land covers. Laboratory analysis was conducted to determine the soil physical properties. This was followed by statistical and geostatistical analysis for characterizing physical properties of soil and their spatial variability. The Coefficient of variation (CV) displayed moderate variability (0.140.36) for measured soil properties except for b which has low variability (CV = 0.08). The variability of soil physical properties under distinct land covers was determined by creating Box plots, and it was revealed that in general, shrubland has significantly lower Ks, b and sand content and higher , silt and clay content than farmland and built-up land covers (P &lt; 0.05) mainly due to lesser anthropogenic activities and continuous vegetal cover in shrub lands. The nugget to sill ratios for all the soil properties showed moderate to strong degree of spatial dependence. For mapping spatial variability of soil parameters, Ordinary Kriging (OK) approach of Geostatistical analysis was utilized revealing Spherical (Sand, b and ); Exponential (clay and Ks) and Gaussian (sand and silt) as the best fit models. Analysis by Morans I signified that about 1850 m sampling interval would be sufficient to detect spatial structure of soil physical properties. The generated spatial interpolation maps could serve as efficient tool for identifying land degradation spots in the study region and suggesting precise land management strategies. 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Pleiades Publishing","English","GIS;  interpolation;  kriging;  land use;  physical property;  soil texture;  spatial variation;  variogram, Himalayas;  Lesser Himalayas","10642293","10.1134/S1064229320030060","3",NA,NA,NA,"362-376","Quantification of Spatial Variability of Soil Physical Properties in a Lesser Himalayan Sub-Basin of India.","selected",NA,"excluded"

Such long-lived monocarpic plants are usually slow growing and can be found in deserts, bogs or in alpine regions of the tropics or sub-tropics. Due to their longevity, monocarpic perennials risk losing everything before reproduction, which make them particularly susceptible to disturbances. Because of the inherent difficulties in assessing whether long-lived populations are growing or declining, usually neither their demography nor the consequences of increasing grazing pressure are known. Methods: We used integral projection modelling (IPM) to measure the growth rate and passage time to flowering of Rheum nobile, a monocarpic perennial, and one of the most striking alpine plants from the high Himalayas. Rosettes which were no longer found due to disturbances or grazing by yaks were either treated as missing or as dead in two series of analysis, thereby simulating demography with and without the impact of grazing cattle. Data were collected from plants at 4500 m a.s.l. in Shangri-la County, Yunnan Province, south-west China. In four consecutive years (2011-2014) and in two populations, 372 and 369 individuals were measured, respectively, and size-dependent growth, survival and fecundity parameters were estimated. In addition, germination percentage, seedling survival and establishment probability were assessed. Key results: The probability of survival, flowering and fecundity were strongly size dependent. Time to reach flowering size was 33.5 years [95 % confidence interval (CI) 21.9-43.3, stochastic estimate from pooled transitions and populations]. The stochastic population growth rate (s) of Rheum nobile was 1.013 (95 % CI 1.010-1.017). When disturbance by grazing cattle (yaks) was accounted for in the model, s dropped to values &lt;1 (0.940, 95 % CI 0.938-0.943). Conclusion: We conclude that natural populations of this unique species are viable, but that conservation efforts should be made to minimize disturbances by grazing and to protect this slow-growing flagship plant from the high Himalayas. 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The present study aimed to understand the composition, distribution pattern, phenology and physiognomic traits of riverine vegetation in Bhaderwah, Jammu and Kashmir, India. Materials and Methods: Organized field surveys were conducted in a mountainous riparian corridor of Neeru stream in Bhaderwah during 2016-2017. The study area forms a linear hydro-morphological unit spanning 30 km in length and ~15-100 m wide located along an elevational range of 850-2200 m. A random sampling technique was used for vegetation sampling. Results: The study corridor is well represented by subtropical, sub-temperate, temperate and alpine elements of vegetation. In all, 248 plant species contained in 193 genera and 78 families were recorded from 45 sampling stations surveyed for all the seasons. Asteraceae dominated the area with 27 species in 20 genera.

Knowledge of genetic diversity and population structure will help guide gene conservation strategies for this species. Ten polymorphic chloroplast microsatellites (cpSS) were used to study genetic diversity and population structure in twenty one natural populations of C. deodara throughout its entire distribution range in Western Himalayas. When alleles at each of the 10 loci were jointly analysed, 254 different haplotypes were identified among 1050 individuals. The cpSSs indicate that C. deodara forests maintain a moderately high level of genetic diversity (mean h = 0.79). AMOVA analysis showed that most of the diversity in C. deodara occurs within populations. Bayesian analysis for population structure (BAPS) revealed spatial structuration of the variation (22 % of the total variation) and substructuring captured nineteen genetic clusters in the entire divisions of the populations. Most of the populations were clustered independently with minor admixtures. The distribution of genetic diversity and sub-structuring of C. deodara may be due to restricted gene flow due to geographic isolation, genetic drift, and natural selection. These findings indicated existence of genetically distinct and different high diversity and low diversity clusters, which are potential groups of populations that require attention for their conservation and management.

Biochemical investigations showed a positive correlation between proteomic plasticity (HrB13) and 1.6 to 15-fold accumulation of downstream adaptive metabolic signatures like enzymes and antioxidants involved in ROS scavenging pathways (Catalase, Ascorbate peroxidase, Glutathione reductase, ascorbate and glutathione content), secondary metabolites (phenolics, flavonoids, carotenoids) and polyunsaturated fatty acids ( linolenic acid and linoleic acid). Interactome and KEGG pathway analysis also supported interactions of differentially accumulated proteins with stress-responsive signaling components involved in physiological pathways associated with stress tolerance. This is the first ecophysiolomics study, showing the response of seabuckthorn to multiple stress conditions via activation of multifactorial acclimation strategies leading to morphological, metabolic and physiological modifications, resulting in dark orange berries in HrB13. Higher accumulation of omega-6 fatty acids, carotenoids and ascorbate during suboptimal growth conditions, provides exciting prospects for enhancing pharmaceutical properties of seabuckthorn berries, emphasizing need to analyze diversity of plant signaling mechanisms under changing climate conditions. 2019 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","English","antioxidant;  reactive oxygen metabolite, acclimatization;  fruit;  Hippophae;  physiological stress;  physiology;  proteomics, Acclimatization;  Antioxidants;  Fruit;  Hippophae;  Proteomics;  Reactive Oxygen Species;  Stress, Physiological","00319317","10.1111/ppl.12942","1",NA,NA,NA,"58-76","Ecophysiolomic Analysis of Stress Tolerant Himalayan Shrub Hipppophae Rhamnoides Shows Multifactorial Acclimation Strategies Induced by Diverse Environmental Conditions.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

We investigated the taxonomic composition of the flora and diversity of growth forms of species and habitats. In addition, we conducted global IUCN Red List assessment of two endemic species, Aristolochia assamica and Chlorophytum assamicum. We found that the vascular plant flora of Behali Reserve Forest consists of 281 taxa, including 272 species, one subspecies and eight varieties. They belong to 206 genera and 79 families. Among them, Pandanus unguifer was recorded for the first time for the flora of Assam. In growth form spectrum of vascular plants, trees, vines and shrubs predominated, followed by epiphytes, forbs or herbs, geophytes, annuals and parasites. The largest number of vascular plants was found in dense forests, while open habitats were characterized by the smallest species richness. Chlorophytum assamicum is assessed as CR B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii); D, and Aristolochia assamica as EN B2ab(iii). At the same time, there is a threat of reduction or disappearance of their populations. This is especially crucial for C. assamicum, represented by a single world population. Undoubtedly, further investigations of flora could result in an increase in number of the vascular plant flora of Behali Reserve Forest, as well as providing essential insights into population trends of several other species as per IUCN Red List categories and criteria. 2020, Babes-Bolyai University, ""Alexandru Borza"" Botanic Garden.

Roadside plantations often act as a first defense line against the vehicular emissions to mitigate the impacts of pollutants. However, they are themselves vulnerable to these pollutants with varying levels of tolerance capacity. This demands a scientific investigation to assess the role of roadside plantation for better management and planning for urban sprawl where selected trees could be grown to mitigate the impacts of harmful pollutants. The present study assesses the impacts of vehicular emissions on the adaptation and mitigation potential of two important roadside tree species i.e. Grevillea robusta and Mangifera indica planted along roadsides in the capital city of Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand is one of the Indian Western Himalayan State and its capital city is situated on the foothills of Himalaya. The adaptation and mitigation potential were evaluated by studying the response of pollutants on the functional traits which drive the physiology of the trees. The CO2 assimilation rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency (WUE), air pollution tolerance index (APTI), copper and proline accumulation, dust removal efficiency (DRE), leaf thickness and cooling created by plantation were studied to evaluate the response of trees exposed to roadside traffics. To compare the influence of pollutants, traits of trees grown in a control site with few or absence of vehicular movement were compared with the roadside trees. The control site represented part of a reserve forest where human interference is controlled and human-induced activities are prohibited. The vehicular frequency was found to modulate tree characteristics. The tree characteristics representing WUE, APTI, proline and copper accumulation, leaf thickness, cooling impact, and DRE were enhanced significantly, while the decreased CO2 assimilation rate was observed near roadside trees compared to the control site. We found both of the species to perform well to be used as one of the potential species for roadside and urban greening. However, there is a need to assess the potential of other species in reference to the present study. 2020 Singh et al.

In the present study, the impact of landuse change (20062016) on runoff and sediment yield has been assessed in Patiala-Ki-Rao watershed (5140 ha) located in Shivalik foot-hills, using remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS), and Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) watershed model. The watershed has seven major landuse classes, namely agriculture, built-up, fallow land, forest, grass land, streams, and water bodies. The landuse change analysis indicated that the area under all the landuses decreased except built-up that increased by 372.27 ha (112.04%). Forest is the most affected landuse among all watershed landuses that shrinked by 194.90 ha followed by agriculture (64.57 ha), grass land (50.81 ha), streams (30.42 ha), fallow land (21.86 ha), and water bodies (9.72 ha). Runoff and sediment yield for the landuse of the years 2006 and 2016 were simulated by the WEPP model using two climate scenarios (2006 and 2016). The simulated runoff, sediment yield, and sediment delivery ratio increased by 18.62%, 48.04%, and 32.23% under Climate-2006 and 26.78%, 30.23%, and 16.09% under Climate-2016 due to change in landuse during a period of 10 years.

Other environmental variables may also influence the species diversity on the northern faces of the mountain and therefore needs to be studied in detail. The northern slopes represent three different sub-slopesnorth, north east, and north west. During the current investigation of Pir-Panjal and Dauladhar ranges in Bhadarwah valley, fine-scale studies on the relationship between vegetation and four variables (soilpH, moisture content, electrical conductivity, and steepness) were conducted. The study determined the role of these variables on the vegetation of three different sub-slopes. The sampling was done at the confluence of two communities (forest and grassland) at three sites on the northern sub-slopes of the lesser stratum in western Himalayan. Results: The result revealed that rich herbaceous diversity prevails on the lesser Himalayan stratum (Bhadarwah valley). As many as 65.8% species differ from site to site, whereas species commonality among the sites is minimum. The role of environmental variables on the species composition at different sub-slopes of the north mountain face is deduced through canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Conclusions: The availability of solar light increases air and soil temperature on the north eastfacing slope. All the environmental variables (soilpH, moisture,electrical conductivity, and mountain steepness) are insignificant at pure north face for the species composition. Therefore, it can be concluded that some other environmental variables may influence the species composition which are needed to be furtherinvestigated. 2019, The Author(s).","Springer","English","Electric conductivity;  Moisture;  Soils;  Vegetation, Canonical Correspondence Analysis;  Environmental variables;  North face;  Species heterogeneity;  Species turnover;  Treeline, Landforms, canonical analysis;  community composition;  correspondence analysis;  ecotone;  environmental conditions;  herb;  heterogeneity;  species richness, Pir Panjal Range, Tracheophyta","21921709","10.1186/s13717-019-0200-x","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Environmental Variables Vis-a-Vis Distribution of Herbaceous Tracheophytes on Northern Sub-Slopes in Western Himalayan Ecotone.","selected",NA,"selected"

Landscape distinguished by the heterogeneity of structure, forms, human interferences, and environmental settings plays an important role in the establishment and spread of invasive species. We investigated the effect of the spatial heterogeneity for a selected landscape upon the invasion process through a case study of Hyptis (Hyptis suaveolens) in the Indian Western Himalayan region. The selected study site constitutes a heterogeneous landscape of 32,300 ha in the state of Uttarakhand, placed at the lower elevation of the Indian Himalaya. The landscape has varying levels and patterns of Hyptis invasion. We quantified the spatial heterogeneity in terms of elevation; distance from the canal, river, road, and settlement; and 18 landscape metrics (at the patch and land use class level) to investigate their influence on the invasion; for this purpose, a logistic regression model was developed. The invasion of Hyptis was found to be governed by spatial heterogeneity. The highest probability of invasion was found in the areas adjacent to rivers and roads. The analysis at patch level revealed that the invasion is largely governed by the perimeter-area ratio of patches and is positively correlated. This suggests for greater invasion chances in smaller patches as compared with larger ones. The analysis for the land use class metrics indicated a higher influence of edge density expressed as total edge length of patches per unit area, followed by patch density expresses as a total number of patches per unit area. Hence, the landscapes with larger edges and more number of patches are supposed to be more prone to invasion risks. The results of the study can be used by forest managers in designing a landscape-level system to control invasion. 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer","English","Biodiversity;  Climate change;  Land use;  Regression analysis, Alien plants;  Biological invasion;  Heterogeneous landscapes;  Human interference;  Landscape metrics;  Logistic Regression modeling;  Spatial heterogeneity;  Sub-pixel classification, Plants (botany), angiosperm;  introduced species;  invasive species;  landscape ecology;  logistics;  pixel;  regression analysis;  spatiotemporal analysis, Article;  environmental aspects and related phenomena;  highway;  Hyptis;  Hyptis suaveolens;  Indian;  land use;  landscape;  nonhuman;  population dynamics;  regression analysis;  river;  seasonal variation;  spatial heterogeneity;  species invasion;  biodiversity;  ecosystem;  environmental monitoring;  introduced species;  plant, Himalayas, Hyptis;  Hyptis suaveolens, Biodiversity;  Ecosystem;  Environmental Monitoring;  Hyptis;  Introduced Species;  Plants","01676369","10.1007/s10661-019-7682-y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Does Spatial Heterogeneity of Landscape Explain the Process of Plant Invasion? a Case Study of Hyptis Suaveolens from Indian Western Himalaya.","selected",NA,"selected"

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the labile organic carbon (LOC) pool and CMI in relation to runoff, soil loss and maize-wheat system productivity on 2% sloping crop lands of Indian Himalayan region in a study (20092014) where different nutrient management practices were adopted. Results showed that all integrated nutrient management (INM) practices (mineral fertilizers with different organic sources like farmyard manure (FYM), vermi-compost (VC), green manure (GM) and poultry manure (PM) enhanced soil aggregation compared with only mineral fertilization (NPK). Among all the treatments, the highest water-stable macroaggregates (+25%) in the 05 cm soil layer were recorded in 50% NPK + 50% FYM (7.5 t ha1) treatment. Aggregate size of &gt;2000, 2502000, 53250 and &lt;53 m had 18, 26, 34 and 18% higher soil aggregate-associated organic C in topsoil than 515 cm soil layer, respectively. Decreasing trend of soil aggregate-associated C was observed with decrease in size fraction from &gt;2000 to &lt;53 m. Plots with fertilization of 50% NPK + 50% GM (1.8 t ha1) had significantly higher Walkley-Black carbon (WBC), total soil organic C (TOC), LOC, macroaggregate-associated C concentrations, and soil aggregation than other treatments. In the NPK + FYM treatment, LOC was 16% significantly higher in topsoil than the sub-surface soil. CMI varied from 1748% to 1541% among the nutrient management practices in the 05 and 515 cm soil layers, respectively. Significant positive correlation was found between CMI with maize yield (r = 0.944; n = 28; p = 0.008), wheat yield (r = 0.942; n = 28; p = 0.005), and negative correlation with runoff (r = 0.818; n = 28; p = 0.042) and soil loss (r = 0.847; n = 28; p = 0.045). FYM, GM, VC and PM with mineral fertilization decreased soil degradation compared to only mineral fertilization and unfertilized control plots, and FYM and GM sources were the best among all the organic sources.

The experiment was carried out in foothills of lower Himalayas. Soil organic carbon (SOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), aggregates associated carbon (AAC), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN) and aggregate associated nitrogen (AAN) were determined from 0 to 15cm and 1530cm soil depths under four cropping systems comprising maizewheat, agro-horticulture, agroforestry 3-year old and 6-year old plantation. The data so obtained was analyzed by using completely randomized designfactorial design at LSD (P &lt; 0.05). The seasonal variations in C and N fractions were significant. The SOC and TN content were higher on an average 7.3mgg1 and 0.86Mgha1 in March than those determined in November (4.9mgg1 and 0.45Mgha1). This is due to higher leaf litter fall in winter months (DecemberFebruary). Lower content of C and N fractions were found in autumn season due to highest rainfall received during the monsoon period (MayOctober) in this region.

To fill this research gap, the whole district was ecologically explored for the collection of field data from August 2014 to July 2016. For vegetation studies, a total of 16 altitudinal transects comprising 110 sampling stations (samples) with 990 plots were studied by using a stratified random vegetation sampling method. Different multivariate statistical tools including Monte Carlo permutation test, Indicator species analysis, hierarchical clustering, ordination, variation partitioning and multi-response permutation procedures tests were used for the first time for the study area to elucidate the number of significant vegetation groups, ranking and placement of plant species in these groups, classification of vegetation units, detection of important gradients, importance of groups of environmental variables and pairwise compositional differences of the species groups respectively. The results showed that all the recorded 343 plant species belong to seven significant plant associations which were further placed into 5 major forest types. Out of the total 19 variables studied, CCA detected the significant contribution of the majority (simple effects: 12; unique effects: 8) of them. The latter (unique effects) in descending order included altitude, forest cover, deforestation, community maturity, forest density, latitude, slope aspect, and longitudinal variations. Similarly, variation partitioning results depicted that topography was the leading driver affecting vegetation distribution, followed by the biotic and edaphic factors. The forest edges, especially the sub-alpine ecosystem, were most diverse, supported higher tree density and also faced maximum deforestation pressure. Furthermore, rangelands in the temperate to alpine zones were affected by heavy overgrazing. Due to the disrupted local ecosystem functioning, the study area needs proper management and conservations plans to save its biodiversity wealth in this part of western Himalaya. 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier B.V.","English","Biodiversity;  Deforestation;  Ecosystems;  Statistical mechanics;  Topography;  Vegetation, Canonical Correspondence Analysis;  Himalayas;  Indicator species analysis;  Variation partitioning;  Vegetation diversities, Multivariant analysis","1470160X","10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.05.048",NA,NA,NA,NA,"723-736","Multivariate Analyses of the Vegetation of the Western Himalayan Forests of Muzaffarabad District, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan.","selected",NA,"selected"

The study evaluates species-area relationships along the elevation gradient, spread over four major forest types i.e., low (tropical to sub-tropical, up to 900m), middle (subtropical, 7501500m), upper (wet temperate, 15002700m) and Rhododendron-Conifer Zone (cold temperate/sub-alpine, 27003600m) with 664 species from 367 genera and 131 families.

The peaks became prominent, with the increase in scale of extent from 100m (R2 = 50%) to 300m (R2 = 78%) through 200m (R2 = 55%) elevation steps, using 2nd order polynomial fitting. The reduction in tree height and richness was noticed beyond 2300m allowing dominance of herbs owing to climatic constraints.

The carbon stocks in the trees, herbs and soil were estimated by using allometric equations, destructive sampling and Walkley-Black method respectively. The average carbon stocks in the alpine region were estimated to be 372.5 t/ha with biomass carbon share of 2.27 tons per hectare while the soil organic carbon stocks share was recorded as 370.6 t/ha. The total carbon stock value of subalpine zone was found to be 340.9 t/ha with biomass carbon reserves as 81.1 t/ha whereas the soil organic carbon as 261 t/ha. Soil carbon contents showed an increasing trend with increasing altitude with alpine zone having higher values as compared to subalpine region. Whereas biomass carbon values showed a negative correlation with altitude with maximum values in sub alpine region as compared to minimum in alpines. Principal Component Analysis revealed altitude as the major factor affecting the carbon stocks. Current study provides the very 1 st scientific information about carbon stocks of western Himalayan highlands with diverse future implications. Carbon sequestration potential was found to be negatively affected by fuel wood extraction, over grazing and soil degradation.

The carbon cycle is closely linked with nitrogen cycles and needs to be studied together for their important implications for mitigating land degradations and associated declining productivity. Within the global biodiversity hotspot ofHimalayas, which constitutes more than one third of Indias carbon pool, the Eastern Himalayas in spite of having highest forest cover, protected area network coverage, biodiversity, and endemicity have been understudied for soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The present study was designed to assess the patterns and determinants of soil carbon stock, SOC stocks, nitrogen stocks, and carbon/nitrogen (C:N) ratio along the altitudinal gradient, forest type, and depth in Darjeeling Himalayas, India. We followed standard protocol for soil sampling and analysis. The soil carbon stocks (257.02 to 527.79MgCha1), SOC stocks (152.55 to 398.88MgCha1), and soil nitrogen stocks (15.10 to 32.38MgNha1) increased (but C:N ratio 15.13 to 19.12 declined) along the altitudinal gradient (154 to 3170m), forest types (tropical moist deciduous forest: MWLS &lt; East Himalayan temperate forest: NVNP &lt; East Himalayan sub-alpine forest: SNP) and annually (year 1 &lt; year 2); however, opposite pattern was observed with increase in depths. The soil carbon stocks, SOC stocks, soil nitrogen stocks, and C:N ratio showed strong effects of forest type, depth, elevation, NDVI, bulk density, MI, and AET. Additionally, there was strong relationship of MAP with soil carbon stock and SOC stock, MAT with C:N ratio, and year of sampling with SOC stocks and C:N ratio. The soil carbon stocks, SOC stocks, and soil nitrogen stocks showed negative correlation with different environmental factors (MAT, MAP, NDVI, MI, AET), but positive correlation with elevation, however, C:N ratio had weakpositive correlation. We conclude that the different forests types of Darjeeling Himalayas encompassing wide elevation gradient have high levels of soil carbon stocks, SOC stocks, soil nitrogen stocks, and C:N ratio, and hence must be properly managed to maximize their soil carbon sequestration potential. 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer International Publishing","English","Biodiversity;  Carbon;  Conservation;  Global warming;  Land use;  Nitrogen;  Soils, C:N ratio;  Elevation;  Himalayas;  Nitrogen stocks;  Soil carbon stock, Forestry, biodiversity;  carbon cycle;  carbon sequestration;  global warming;  isotopic ratio;  soil carbon;  soil nitrogen, actual evapotranspiration;  altitude;  altitudinal gradient;  Article;  bulk density;  carbon nitrogen ratio;  controlled study;  correlation analysis;  environmental factor;  environmental parameters;  forest;  India;  mean annual precipitation;  mean annual temperature;  moisture index;  normalized difference vegetation;  sampling;  soil analysis;  soil carbon stock;  soil depth;  soil nitrogen stock;  soil sampling;  tropical moist deciduous forest;  altitude;  carbon cycle;  carbon sequestration;  chemistry;  climate change;  environmental monitoring;  soil, Darjeeling;  India;  West Bengal, carbon;  nitrogen, Altitude;  Carbon;  Carbon Cycle;  Carbon Sequestration;  Climate Change;  Environmental Monitoring;  Forests;  India;  Nitrogen;  Soil","01676369","10.1007/s10661-019-7470-8","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Stocks along the Altitudinal Gradient of the Darjeeling Himalayas, India.","selected",NA,"excluded"

Several investigations have attempted to study the global patterns in the 13 C C3 values and their correlation with the precipitation variability. Sparse representation of dataset from low-latitude and equatorial regions in the existing global compilation hinders to understand the precipitation- 13 C C3 gradient at different latitudinal-bands. In the present study, available global compilation has been extended with the newly measured dataset, and the new compilation (ca. 1.5 times larger than previous dataset) comprises results from 720 sites across the world. All the 13 C C3 values have been converted to carbon isotopic discrimination between air and leaf ( air-leaf ). Mann-Whitney analysis indicates distinct region-specific distribution of the air-leaf values. The average air-leaf value in mid-latitude region of the Northern Hemisphere is ca. 2 lower than equatorial sites. Multiple linear models have been used to investigate relative influence of climatic (precipitation and temperature) and geographical factors (altitude and latitude) on the air-leaf values. This analysis shows that precipitation controls the air-leaf values in every latitudinal-bin though the effect of precipitation is negligible beyond 1500 mm. Furthermore, the air-leaf -precipitation gradient has a large spatial variability and the most prominent changes in the air-leaf values have been observed at arid regions in mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere (maximum 1.3 100 mm 1 ). Region-specific distribution of 13 C values of plant and air-leaf -precipitation gradient prompt to recalculate the relative abundance of C 3 C 4 plants in the Siwalik sections of the Himalayan foreland basin. Our results show that earlier investigations in the Siwaliks for the Middle-Late Miocene have underestimated the abundance of C 4 plants by ca. 20%. The recalculation shows that C 4 plants existed in these regions earlier (ca. 17 Ma) than the previously proposed timings. 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","English","Isotopes;  Precipitation (meteorology), Carbon isotopic composition;  Multiple linear models;  Paleoenvironmental reconstruction;  Precipitation controls;  Precipitation gradients;  Precipitation variability;  Sparse representation;  Specific distribution, Carbon, C3 plant;  carbon isotope;  discriminant analysis;  global perspective;  heterogeneity;  isotopic composition;  Northern Hemisphere;  paleoenvironment;  precipitation (climatology);  proxy climate record;  reconstruction;  relative abundance;  Southern Hemisphere;  spatial analysis, Siwalik Hills","09218181","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.02.002",NA,NA,NA,NA,"123-131","Spatial Heterogeneity in the Relationship Between Precipitation and Carbon Isotopic Discrimination in c 3 Plants: Inferences from a Global Compilation.","selected",NA,"excluded"

Nineteen major phytolith types recovered from foliages and shoots of the pteridophytes are assessed for their potential to distinguish different vegetation zones, if any. Combined data suggest that epidermal polygonal (EP), jig saw plate (JSP), cast of epidermal cells (CEC), globular folded (GF), polyhedral bodies (PB), hair cell base (HCB) and silicified tracheids (TR) are the most significant phytolith morphotypes produced along the tropicaltemperate vegetation belts. Of these, CEC and GF could successfully discriminate tropical and sub-tropical from temperate vegetation. PB may be used as indicator of sub-tropical/lower-temperate vegetation and climate, and HCB as indicator of sub-tropicaltemperate vegetation and climate. Cluster analysis (CA) applied on the pteridophyte phytolith data shows morphotype signal for different vegetation zones. Discriminant analysis (DA), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) have arranged pteridophytic phytolith assemblages along the evapotranspiration and moisture availability gradients, approximating the actual distribution of vegetation along the rising elevation. DA has classified 75% of the taxa into their correct vegetation zones. Misclassification by DA may be attributed to the redundancy of the phytolith morphotypes among the studied taxa and indicating that caution should be taken when applying them in the fossil phytolith assemblages. The study infers a combined influence of climateenergy and moisture availability on the elevational distribution of the pteridophytic phytoliths in the eastern Himalaya.

Among these, air pollution has generated much interest, since it has a major influence on the transboundary dispersion of pollutants globally. Air pollution tolerance index (APTI) value represents tolerance level of plants which help in selecting the most suitable plant species for plantation in/around affected areas. This parameter in conjunction with Anticipated Performance Index (API) can provide a logical solution for green belt development by considering biological and socio-economic aspect of the species and help in reducing the levels of pollutants. The present study was conducted in Himachal Pradesh, constituting a very vital part of the Indian Himalayan Region. In the present study, APTI and API values of six commonly growing temperate and sub-temperate plant species viz., Quercus leucotrichophora, Rubus ellipticus, Debregeasia saeneb, Hypericum oblongifolium, Punica granatum, and Grevillea robusta, were evaluated along the National Highway-5 in Himachal Pradesh.

Since all the Siwalik floras of the eastern Himalaya (Darjeeling and Arunachal Pradesh) spanning the mid-Miocene to Pleistocene yield almost the same values we suggest that overall the eastern Himalayan Siwalik climate appears to have been remarkably uniform over the past 15 million years. The MAT result of the Bhutan Siwalik flora differs by just 0.6 C from Arunachal and 1.2 C from Darjeeling Siwalik floras. For all Siwalik fossil assemblages, WMMTs, CMMTs and LGSs (length of the growing season) are similar and consistent (WMMTs around 28 C, CMMTs around 18 C and LGSs around 12 months). Similarly, the mean annual relative humidity (RH) and specific humidity (SH) appear to have been uniformly around 80% and 14 g/kg respectively throughout the Neogene of the eastern Himalayan Siwaliks. Changes in the monsoon index suggest that in both Bhutan and Arunachal sub-Himalaya, there has been little change in the intensity of the monsoon since mid-Miocene time, while further west in the Darjeeling area precipitation seasonality has increased since the mid-Miocene. 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","English","calibration;  estimation method;  floral trait;  fossil assemblage;  fossil record;  growing season;  leaf;  Miocene;  monsoon;  morphotype;  Neogene;  paleoclimate;  Pliocene;  seasonality, Arunachal Pradesh;  Bhutan;  Darjeeling;  Himalayas;  India;  Siwalik Hills;  West Bengal","00310182","10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.10.019",NA,NA,NA,NA,"326-335","Palaeoclimatic Estimates for a Latest Miocene-Pliocene Flora from the Siwalik Group of Bhutan: Evidence for the Development of the South Asian Monsoon in the Eastern Himalaya.","selected",NA,"excluded"

Hence, there is a need for better understanding of the drivers of forest fire to aid efficient management, but these efforts are hampered by the deficiency of spatial and temporal data on fire incidences. Advancement in remote sensing technology provides an opportunity to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of wildfires in relation to anthropogenic, ecological, and environmental drivers. We used MODIS fire data from 2001 to 2015 to understand fire incidences in Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR), an important tiger habitat area in the Himalayan terai region. We analyzed fire incidences to understand monthly and inter-annual variation of fire incidences at two spatial scales: first, using only climatic variables considering VTR as a single spatial unit and the second, to understand the fire dynamics at 1 km2 spatial resolution using climatic, ecological, and anthropogenic variables. The results show that fire incidences occurred from January to May, 88% of which occurred in March and April. Overall, different variables affected fire incidences in March and April for both the temporal models. Precipitation had a significant negative effect on fire incidences in both March and April, but temperature had a positive effect only in March. Similarly, the fine scale temporal model showed that while ecological (litter load, NPP) and anthropogenic (distance to villages and roads) variables influenced fire incidences in March, altitude and village area surrounding the forest affected fires in April. Litter input, distance to nearest villages, and village area had a non-linear relationship with fire incidences indicating a few inconsistencies with the global patterns of fire with human activity. We show that the Sal dominated forests and terai grasslands at low altitudes (200 m), falling within a zone of 2.53 km from villages and with good road connectivity are more prone to fire. The fine-scale fire prediction map of VTR will be helpful to the Tiger Reserve management in developing appropriate strategies for the fire prone areas. 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","English","Climate change;  Deforestation;  Ecology;  Environmental technology;  Fire hazards;  Highway administration;  Radiometers;  Remote sensing;  Rural areas;  State space methods, Anthropogenic influence;  Fire management;  Forest fires;  Himalayan terai;  MODIS;  Negative binomial models;  Poisson regression, Fires, annual variation;  anthropogenic effect;  conservation management;  conservation planning;  environmental factor;  felid;  forest fire;  human activity;  MODIS;  Poisson ratio;  protected area;  regression analysis;  remote sensing;  satellite data;  spatial resolution;  spatiotemporal analysis;  tropical forest;  vegetation structure, Area;  Data;  Deforestation;  Ecology;  Forest Fires;  Patterns;  Remote Sensing;  Variables, Himalayas","03781127","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.10.009",NA,NA,NA,NA,"902-911","a Fine-Scale State-Space Model to Understand Drivers of Forest Fires in the Himalayan Foothills.","selected",NA,"selected"

This study presents information on the plant diversity of Devi Pindiyan Valley of Trikuta Hills. Several line-transect (100m N-S and 100 E-W) surveys were conducted in which nested quadrats of 10m 10m were laid for trees, within which interspersed two 5m 5m sub-quadrats for shrubs and five 1m 1m sub-quadrants for herbs at different places for determination of floristic composition. In the diverse habitats of this valley, we recorded 213 vascular plant species belonging to 164 genera under 71 families. This study area also harbors rich diversity of fungi, where the most visible 7 species of macrofungi belongs to 7 genera and 4 families were documented. Out of the documented species, 35 species have been categorized as threatened based on the latest IUCN Red list criteria, while 178 species are included in the catalogue of world life. Engelhardtia spicata Lechen ex Blume var. integra (Kurz) Manning ex Steenis has been categorized as Least Concerned (LC) by IUCN Red List site. The species diversity indicates the high conservation value of this area and documenting such an ecologically rich ecosystem becomes a prerequisite for developing and formulating conservation-cum-management strategies.

A total of 9 sites, including 2 in the city and 7 in suburban areas, were sampled using random quadrate methods. The sampled flora were classified according to the phytogeographic origin and invasion status, whereas the phytosocioogoical attributes of plant communites were also calculated following standard protocols. A total of 121 plant species represented by 108 genera belonging to 58 families was recorded from the study area. Results revealed that 35.6% flora comprised of 43 species were recorded as IAS. The IAS dominating the area included Parthenium hysterophorus, Lantana camara, Xanthium strumarium, Ailanthus aItissima, Cannabis sativa, Broussonetia papyrifera, Arundo donax and Sorghum halepense. Analysis of the Invasion status revealed that invasive aliens had a weight of 46% followed by naturalized aliens and casual aliens, respectively. The dominance of invasive species resulted in decreased species diversity at the disturbed sites. Landslides and road construction were identified as factors promoting the establishment and spread of invasive species in the area.

The disparity in the abundance of C4 plants across different regions of the Kangra sub-basin, NW Himalaya, has been attributed to variation in grain size of the substrate and its moisture content. In the absence of vegetation and climate data from the Upper Siwaliks of the Kangra sub-basin, the present study considers the adjacent Subathu sub-basin. The 13C values of soil carbonate nodule (SC) from the Ghaggar and Moginanda regions and fossil tooth enamel from the Haripur Khol region of the Subathu sub-basin have been measured and compared to data from the other Siwalik regions to assess the spatio-temporal distribution of C4 plants. Additionally, the 18OSC values have been evaluated to reconstruct local climatic conditions. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope data from SC across the Siwaliks indicate that climate was not the only driver influencing the C4 plant abundance. Comparison of the sedimentary architecture among the different Siwalik regions indicates that the abundance of overbank fine sediments is higher in the western Siwaliks than the central and eastern Siwaliks.

In case of shrubs, Simpsons dominance index significantly (P<0.007) increased along the disturbance gradient, whereas Pielous evenness index significantly (P<0.005) decreased with an increasing level of disturbance. Shannon-Weiner diversity index for herbs significantly (P<0.016) increased with increasing disturbance whereas, Simpsons dominance index was significantly (P<0.013) declined along the disturbance gradient. Results revealed that 1050 cm dbh classes constituted the highest stem density, and highest basal area was recorded in the >100 cm dbh class in all three sites. Density of the matured trees decreased with increasing DBH whereas, tree basal area tended to increase with increasing DBH in all three sites. Tree species richness was highest in the lower DBH classes. 62.07% of the total tree species regenerated in the largely undisturbed site followed by 50% in the mildly disturbed and 26.32% in the highly disturbed site. The overall regeneration condition was found to be good in the largely undisturbed site. Mildly disturbed site exhibited fair regeneration and so was in the highly disturbed site. Discernable variations in species composition, diversity, regeneration and tree population structure revealed the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on rainforest vegetation dynamics. Higher degree of disturbance was furtherly found not only affecting species diversity but also promoting the growth of invasive weed species. Dominance of Hydnocarpus kurzii and Crypteronia paniculata in the highly disturbed site also indicated that these less-valued timber species may benefit from the vegetation mosaic produced by the disturbance; so differences in abundance of these species may be useful for bio-indication.

Productivity assessment was done at five locations, viz. open forest area; enclosed forest area; community land; farmers field; and wasteland in each hill zone. High species richness and diversity was observed in mid hill zone as compared to low and high hills. The mean production level was recorded highest in low hills closely followed by mid hills; much less in high hills. Amongst the land-use systems, highest biomass production was recorded at farmers field followed by community land and least in wasteland situation. The average herbage production obtained through six cuts at periodic intervals (March to December) was 3,202 DM kg/ha, while in single harvest it was 2,249 DM kg/ha (low-hill conditions); 2,893 and 1,924 DM kg/ha (mid-hill conditions) and 1,399 and 850 DM kg/ha (high-hill conditions), respectively. Averaged over the different locations, 6.01, 6.64 and 10.87% crude protein (CP) was observed (in multicut situation) in low, mid and high hills respectively. Average herbage production obtained through six cuts at periodical intervals (March-December) was consistently higher as compared to single harvest in all the three zones. 2018 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

In spite of the huge commercial prospective, the phytonutrient and chemometric profiles of Himalayan oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) have not been evaluated, and their relationships with ecological parameters are still lacking. The objective of this research study was to evaluate the disparity in the phytonutrient profiles of different ecotypes of O. vulgare in wild and cultivated populations and determine whether such variation was related to the diverse climatic and edaphic conditions prevailing in the northwestern Himalayas. Micrometeorological, atomic absorption spectroscopy for micro-elemental analysis was determined for soil. HPLC was used to determine the disparity in phytonutrient (quercetin, betacarotene, ascorbic acid, and catechin) and phytochemical (arbutin) levels. Cultivated populations had lower phytonutrient levels than wild populations. The habitat exhibiting pH values ranging from 6 to 7 elevated organic carbon (2.42%), nitrogen (97.41kgha1), and manganese (1012gg1) and zinc contents (0.390.50%) show luxirant growth of Origanum vulgarel. The phytonutrient (quercetin, betacarotene, ascorbic acid, arbutin, and catechin) levels had a direct relationship with UV-B flux (r2 = 0.82) and potassium (r2 = 0.97). Wild accessions predominantly contained catechin and ascorbic acid, with maximum values of 163.8 and 46.88g g1, respectively, while the cultivated accessions had the highest level of arbutin (53.42g g1). Maximum variation was observed in quercetin (114.61%) followed by -carotene (87.53%). Cultivated accessions had less quercetin (0.041.25g g1) than wild accessions (1.252.87g g1). Wild accessions had higher phytonutrient values for catechin, -carotene, and ascorbic acid while cultivated accessions had maximum values for arbutin.

This paper (i) sheds light on treeline distribution along Himalayan Arc; (ii) discusses factors affecting treeline elevation in a warming world; (iii) reports initial findings of a multi-site and multi-partner research project on Himalayan treelines; and (iv) analyses future research needs. The Himalayan treeline elevation increases from the north-west to south-east along the Arc, and is higher on south aspect than north aspect and in inner ranges than outer ranges. Apart from heat deficiency, several factors such as mass elevation effect and height of the nearest mountains and changes in grazing pressure influence treeline elevation in Himalayas. The principal treeline ecotone genera are Betula, Abies, Rhododendron and Juniperus. The treeline maps developed with remote sensing techniques at a regional level show that the elevations of the nearest mountain summit influence treeline elevations to an extent. Temperature Lapse Rate (~0.53 C/100 m) estimated from observed data, is found lower than generally used in literature, and differs seasonally and across aspects. Our tree water relation study suggests that water is not a limiting factor in treeline ecotone, however, data on tree ring width chronology emphasize the significance of pre-monsoon drought in treeline dynamics. Tree species richness increases from west to east, but the same way not apply to other growth forms. Rhododendron campanulatum seems to move up rapidly, and thus, has potential to influence the ecology of alpine meadows. Treeline and livelihood issues need to be managed to conserve treeline ecotones. Long term treeline studies are required to make generalizations in the context of climate change.

Muzaffarabad district as part of western Himalayan is a strongly seasonal area, thus studies on interrelationship of timing of phenological periodic events and climatic seasonality is of obvious significance. A first ever detailedeco-taxonomical field survey of the whole district was conducted to explore floral diversity, plant habit associated with microhabitats. Timing of flowering response of species within the different months was also recorded during two consective years (2014-16) and flowering phonological data was stored as binary data matrix. The influence of studied climatic variables on the flowering phenological response was tested through canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). A total of 748 vascular plants (740 species, 3 sub-species, 5 varieties) belonged to 490 genera and 120 plant families were recorded including 77 species as new to the study area. The leading plant family was Compositae (69 spp., 9.22%), followed by Poaceae (57 spp., 7.62%), Leguminosae (54 spp., 7.22%), Lamiaceae (42 spp., 5.61%) and Rosaceae (29 spp., 3.88%); while the leading genus was Euphorbia (10 spp.), followed by Cyperus, Ficus, Geranium and Prunus (7spp. each). With respect to life forms, perennial herbs were the most dominant (297 spp., 39.71%), followed by annual herbs (188 spp., 25.13%). With reference to diversity of microhabitats, coniferous forest was leading in terms of floristic diversity having 243 species (32.10% of total flora), followed by drier slopes, home gardens (158 spp., 20.87% each), arable land (143 spp., 18.89%) and waste places (122 spp., 16.12%).The majority of plant species found in flowering stage during July and August months (473 spp., 62.48% and 458 spp., 60.5% respectively),while the least ones during January (51 spp., 6.73%) and December (55 spp., 7.26%). Results of CCA showed that total variations in the response data were 1.742 and 71.8% were explained by the explanatory variables. Based on conditional (net) term effects, mean monthly minimum temperature was detected as the most important and significant [pseudo-F 4.3; p(adj) 0.005] towards explaining the variations in the flowering response data. It was followed by wind speed [pseudo-F 2.9; p(adj) 0.0225] and relative humidity [pseudo-F 2; p(adj) 0.04625] variable. Intrestingly, July and August months not only receive maximum rainfall but also majority of species flowered in these months, but CCA results confirmed that rainfall is not important predictor with respect to species flowering response event in the area. It was concluded that the flora of the study area was more influenced by the climatic factors like temperature, wind speed and relative humidity. This Himalayan region is fragile and rapid temperature rise could lead to catastrophies like wiping out of endemic and endangered species, earlier snowmelts and resultant ealier blooming causing invasive species spread, upwards timber-line shift and rapid changes in vegetation composition. This baseline study information could be used to deal these issues and need to have effective regional collaboration of scientific community and policy makers is recommended. 2018, Pakistan Botanical Society.

Furthermore, ECs significantly enhanced biomass production (root and shoot), although declined night leaf respiration. Overall, it was summarized that photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, leaf, and soil carbon and biomass increased under ECs rendering the physiological adaptation to the plant.

Biological invasion is one of such concerns. In the present study, we modeled how change in global climate and regional anthropogenic pressure can impact the distribution of invasive Lantana camara in the Upper Ganga valley of the Western Himalaya (India). The forest in the study area was stratified into 1 km2 grid and two 15 m radius plot were located in each of the forest types in the grid, for recording Lantana presence. In total, 2221 plots were sampled covering 22% of forest. We used predictors representing the climate, forest patch size, fire and natural disaster variables for modeling the species distribution using maximum entropy algorithm. We further simulated 12 future landscape scenarios based on the global trends of these parameters. The present speciesenvironment relationship was projected to these future landscape scenarios. Lantana was presently estimated to spread in 231 km2 of the study area. It invaded larger forest patches in the sub-tropical region, and smaller disturbed forest patches in the warm and cold temperate region. Increased distribution of Lantana was projected across all the future scenarios.

For this total 50 cores of P. roxburghii were collected from 30 trees. The standard methodology was used for sample preparation and analysis. A 165-year long chronology spanning from 1851 to 2015 AD was constructed from the cores. The result showed that the tree ring chronology of P. roxburghii in study site was positively correlated with pre-monsoon (March and April) rainfall and negatively correlated with the temperature of November of previous growth year and February, March and April of present growth year. However, the analysis of climate response to temperature revealed that there was a negative response of chronology for pre-monsoon season especially for monthly average temperature of April of current year whereas the response with rainfall was positive for pre-monsoon season, but they were statistically insignificant. From this study, it was concluded that the growth of P. roxburghii was limited by the pre-monsoon temperature particularly by April temperature. This conifer (P. roxburghii) has been recommended as a good choice of tree for the past climate study. The main problem with this species is that it contains several false rings and sometimes there is absent ring as well. To overcome such problems, a detailed study encompassing anatomical features to identify and locate false and missing rings is suggested. 2018, Pakistan Botanical Society.

Soil erosion prediction technology began over 70 years ago when Austin Zingg published a relationship between soil erosion by water and land slope and length, followed shortly by a relationship by Dwight Smith that expanded this equation to include conservation practices. But, it was nearly 20 years before this work led to the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), perhaps the foremost achievement in soil erosion prediction in the last century. The total land area affected by water erosion is estimated to be about 1 billion ha, of which 750 million ha are severely affected. There are also regional hot spots of erosion including the Himalayan-Tibetan ecosystem in South Asia, the Loess Plateau in China, the subhumid and semiarid regions of sub-Saharan Africa, highlands of Central America, the Andean region, Haiti and the Caribbean. Soil erosion by water usually begins when raindrops first strike the land's surface and detach and transport soil particles which cause sealing and compacting of the soil surface. Eroded soil is transported downslope by raindrop splash. When runoff water concentrates, and flows through fingerlike channels (rills) from upland areas carrying soil particles, the erosion is called rill erosion, and the soil eroded from between rills is called inter-rill erosion. Once rill erosion begins, it typically progresses up slope by a series of intensely erodible head cuts. Places, where concentrated runoff from a slope is sufficient in volume and velocity to cut deep trenches or where concentrated water continues cutting in the same groove (such as rill) making a deep soil incision, are referred to as gully. The advance stage of gully erosion leads to ravine erosion. There may be both natural (neo-tectonic) and anthropogenic factors responsible for ravine formation. Recent studies indicate that gully erosion is one of the most dangerous threats to agricultural lands and represents an important sediment source in a range of environments; and gullies are effective links for transferring runoff and sediment from uplands to valley bottoms and permanent channels where they aggravate off-site effects of water erosion. During the last two decades, a significant progress in the understanding of gully erosion and its controlling factors has been made, and bulk of research papers have been brought out on various aspects of gully erosion including on modelling predicting the processes of gully erosion. Yet, there remain several research gaps and unanswered questions related to gully erosion, which include historical studies on gully erosion for better understanding of different stages of their formation; appropriate measuring techniques for monitoring or better understanding of the geological and hydrological parameters and processes of gully development; interaction of hydrological and other soil degradation processes; impact of climate and environmental changes on soil erosion processes; development of effective and reliable gully erosion models; and effective gully prevention and control measures and watershed-based management options. In the present book, an attempt has been made to address some of these aspects along with impacts of ravine formation on socio-economic and policy issues.

This lowland region is mainly characterised by tall grasslands, scrub savannah, Sal forests, wetlands, and swamps. The Terai eco-region, shared by India and Nepal, is one of the prominent areas of India from a biodiversity point of view. It is situated along the foothills of the central Himalaya, in the north of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, with a forest covers of ca. 10,000 km 2 in India. The Terai eco-region contains dense forests, savannahs and grasslands, providing critical habitats for many endangered large mammals, including tigers, elephants and rhinoceroses. Currently, the forest of this region is losing its biodiversity because of natural and anthropogenic factors. Because of the high agricultural productivity of the Terai areas, rising aspirations for better living conditions, development activities, industries and road &amp; rail networks, the degradation and fragmentation of these forests have increased in recent years.

The most litter (5.61Mgha1) was produced by T. grandis plantation and the least (4.72Mgha1) by L. parviflora. The material turnover rate to the soil through decomposition from total litter was fastest during the first quarter of the year and subsequently decreased during the next two quarters. The material turnover rate was only 1year, which indicates that more than 90% of the total litter produced decomposed within a year. The available primary nutrient content in litter varied across the four plantations over the year. The plantations generally did not significantly influence the soil physical characteristics but did significantly influence the availability of primary nutrients and organic carbon at two depths (115 and 1630cm) over the year. The availability of soil primary nutrients in the four plantations also increased gradually from the first quarter of the year to the third quarter and then decreased during the last quarter to the same level as in the first quarter of the year at both depths. The availability for soil organic carbon in the plantations followed a similar trend. The amount of litter produced and the material turnover in the soil in the different plantations differed, influencing the nutrient availability and organic carbon at the plantations. The amount of soil organic carbon was highest for T. grandis (2.52Mgha1) and lowest for L. parviflora (2.12Mgha1).

It is far less invasive than two congeneric species from the same area, I. glandulifera and I. parviflora. The factors responsible for its limited success are poorly known, though they may be related to low frost tolerance and low popularity as an ornamental plant. Maladaptive habitat preferences, a factor not studied to date, may also play an important role. The aim of this study was to determine those responsible factors and to examine the consequences of habitat selection by I. balfourii on the Swiss-Italian border, where the species is assumed to be invasive. After exhaustive mapping of its distribution and measurement of the plants' performance parameters, we checked for signs of disease and pest attack on individual plants growing in different habitats, and analysed the local abiotic characteristics. The distribution pattern differed significantly between the two studied countries. There were four times as many Italian localities of I. balfourii and they were clearly concentrated along roadsides, whereas the few Swiss localities were scattered among other habitats. The level of leaf damage along roadsides was lower, suggesting higher release from natural enemies there, which, however, did not translate into investment in plant size or fecundity. Patch area along roadsides correlated positively with the presence of buildings and shading; the plant's ability to spread decreased with elevation. These results confirm that invasion by this shade-tolerant species is driven by propagule pressure and that its dispersal ability is low; that may change with climate warming. Although roads provide suitable conditions and invasion corridors, and despite possibly higher propagule pressure on the Swiss side, in Switzerland the preference for this habitat is maladaptive for I. balfourii, due to intensive mowing, which seems to create an ecological trap. 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Elsevier GmbH","English","adaptation;  alpine environment;  biological invasion;  fecundity;  habitat corridor;  habitat selection;  herb;  introduced species;  invasive species;  limiting factor;  natural enemy;  ornamental species;  patch dynamics;  propagule;  roadside environment;  shade tolerance;  twentieth century, Himalayas;  Italy;  Switzerland, Impatiens balfourii","03672530","10.1016/j.flora.2017.08.002",NA,NA,NA,NA,"224-232","Factors Limiting and Promoting Invasion of Alien Impatiens Balfourii in Alpine Foothills.","selected",NA,"excluded"

The soil carbon content was determined by the WalkleyBlack titration method. The average soil carbon stock was found to be 2.59 kg m2. The average soil carbon stocks in closed canopy forests, open forests, and disturbed forests were 3.39, 2.06, and 2.86 kg m2, respectively. The average soil carbon stock in the agricultural soils was 2.03 kg m2. The carbon stocks showed a significant decreasing trend with the altitudinal gradient with maximum values of 4.13 kg m2 at 9001200 m a.s.l. and minimum value of 1.55 kg m2 at 21002400 m a.s.l. The agricultural soil showed the least carbon content values indicating negative impacts of soil plowing, overgrazing, and soil degradation. Lower carbon values at higher altitudes attest to the immature character of forest stands, as well as to degradation due to immense fuel wood extraction, timber extraction, and harsh climatic conditions.

Their presence indicates a warm and humid tropical environment in the region during the period of Siwalik sedimentation. Considering all records of Calophyllum, it is suggested that Calophyllum was a frequent forest element throughout the period of Siwalik sedimentation during the Neogene (Miocene time). At present, C. polyanthum grows in the eastern Himalaya, but C. inophyllum is totally absent from north-eastern regions suggesting differential adaptability of these taxa to changing ecoclimatic conditions. Distinct climate change in the area, possibly related to the Himalayan Orogeny during MiocenePleistocene times, might have caused the disappearance of C. inophyllum from the entire eastern Himalaya and north-east Indian plains and a move to littoral/coastal and swampy forests of India and other adjoining south-east Asian regions, Polynesia, and the east coast of Africa.

These models also typically ignore topographically driven lateral redistribution of water (either as groundwater or surface flows), both within and between model grid cells. Here, we present a first attempt to quantify the effects of spatial heterogeneity and lateral redistribution on grid-cell-averaged evapotranspiration (ET) as seen from the atmosphere over heterogeneous landscapes. Our approach uses Budyko curves, as a simple model of ET as a function of atmospheric forcing by <i>P</i> and PET. From these Budyko curves, we derive a simple sub-grid closure relation that quantifies how spatial heterogeneity affects average ET as seen from the atmosphere. We show that averaging over sub-grid heterogeneity in P and PET, as typical Earth system models do, leads to overestimations of average ET. For a sample high-relief grid cell in the Himalayas, this overestimation bias is shown to be roughly 12%; for adjacent lower-relief grid cells, it is substantially smaller. We use a similar approach to derive sub-grid closure relations that quantify how lateral redistribution of water could alter average ET as seen from the atmosphere. We derive expressions for the maximum possible effect of lateral redistribution on average ET, and the amount of lateral redistribution required to achieve this effect, using only estimates of P and PET in possible source and recipient locations as inputs. We show that where the aridity index P/PET increases with altitude, gravitationally driven lateral redistribution will increase average ET (and models that overlook lateral redistribution will underestimate average ET). Conversely, where the aridity index P/PET decreases with altitude, gravitationally driven lateral redistribution will decrease average ET. The effects of both sub-grid heterogeneity and lateral redistribution will be most pronounced where P is inversely correlated with PET across the landscape. Our analysis provides first-order estimates of the magnitudes of these sub-grid effects, as a guide for more detailed modeling and analysis. 2017 The Author(s).","Copernicus GmbH","English","Cells;  Cytology;  Groundwater, Atmospheric forcing;  Detailed modeling;  Earth system model;  Heterogeneous landscapes;  Land surface properties;  Potential evapotranspiration;  Simple modeling;  Spatial heterogeneity, Evapotranspiration, atmospheric forcing;  climate modeling;  evapotranspiration;  heterogeneity;  land surface;  potential evapotranspiration;  precipitation (climatology);  soil column, Himalayas","10275606","10.5194/hess-21-217-2017","1",NA,NA,NA,"217-233","a Budyko Framework for Estimating How Spatial Heterogeneity and Lateral Moisture Redistribution Affect Average Evapotranspiration Rates as Seen from the Atmosphere.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

They support unique flora and fauna as well as provide ecological services that are beneficial to society Wetlands are among the most important and productive ecosystems on Earth. India is blessed with water resources and has a rich diversity of inland and coastal wetlands. Wetlands in India are distributed from the cold arid Trans-Himalayan zone to the wet Teri region of the Himalayan foothills, to the Gangetic plains extended to the flood-plains of Brahmaputra, and to the swamps of Northeastern India including the saline expanses of Gujarat and Rajasthan. This study is about three major natural wetlands of Eastern India: Sundarbans, Chilika and Kolleru. The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world. It covers an area of about 1 m. ha. Sixty percent of this wetland is located in Bangladesh and the rest of the forty percent is in India. The Indian part of the Sundarbans is situated in the western part of the GangesBrahmaputra delta, and is extended from the Hooghly River in the west to the Raimangal River in the southeastern portion of the West Bengal State, spreading over two districts: North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas. The Chilika is the worlds second largest brackish water lagoon, and it is situated along the east coast of India in the state of Orissa on the Bay of Bengal with an area of 116,500 ha. The Chilika is extended over eight blocks of three districts; these districts are known as Ganjam, Khurda and Puri. This pear-shaped lake is about 64.5 km. long; its width varies from 18 km. to 5 km. The water spread area of the lake varies from 906 sq. km. to 1165 sq. km. depending upon the seasons. The Kolleru Lake is extended over the Krishna and West Godavari districts along the east coast of India in the state of Andra Pradesh. Kolleru is a large natural freshwater lake, with the catchment area being 4763 sq. km. Although the lake is about 35 km. inland from the present coast, it used to be a coastal lagoon in the past. Kolleru still maintains its connection with the Bay of Bengal through a 60 km long tidal channel called Upputeru. The average depth of the lake varies from 0.5 m. to 2.0m. This study offers a new sampling design; blocks in and around the specific wetland were stratified into three clusters, according to their distance from the specified wetland. Samples were chosen mostly from the blocks closest to the wetland, with minimal samples chosen from the blocks most distant from the wetland. Four different schedules were canvassed to four different groups of people: householders, entrepreneurs, tourists, and experts on wetlands. A new approach has been introduced for valuing the wetlands. This approach attempts to combine valuation of a wetland to the aforementioned groups of people. It also attempts to incorporate the valuation of the wetlands when used for other purposes. 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

One of the key corridors of Terai Arc Landscape, in the Himalayan foothills of northern India, Kosi River corridor provides crucial linkage between the Jim Corbett Tiger Reserve and the Ramnagar Forest Division. Growing anthropogenic disturbances in the landscape have led to fragmentation of existing wildlife habitats. The changes were mapped using remotely sensed multi-date satellite images (2009 and 2014) in geographic information system. Land Change Modeler was used to predict LULC distribution for 2020 and 2030 using current disturbance scenarios. The predicted map showed that if the current probability of change persists, dense forest would witness a decline of about 8.5 km in area, while area under plantation would occupy 4.31% (27.9 km2) of the total area by 2030. These changes are significant given the fact that the area is under protected area status. The study indicates that manmade obstructions, in the form of construction of resorts, buildings and residential houses, all along the Kosi River are the major reasons for increasing deforestation.

It has long been suspected that the Kamala tree (Mallotus philippinensis) can serve as an indicator of the distribution for Asian elephants during the dry season in northwestern India. However, there is little direct evidence in support of this speculation, especially at a large landscape scale. Here, we predicted the distribution of Kamala trees in the Shivalik landscape of northwestern India based on topographic and bioclimatic variables, as well as satellite-derived vegetation indices and forest canopy height data using a presence-only ecological niche model. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and true skill statistic (TSS) to validate the model. We then examined the relationship between the occurrence probability of Kamala trees and the presence of Asian elephants with data collected during dry seasons between 2010 and 2014 using logistic regression models. Our results showed that the probability of occurrence of Kamala trees was predicted with good accuracy (AUC = 0.88 and TSS = 0.51). The logistic regression models showed that the presence of Asian elephants can be adequately predicted by the occurrence probability of Kamala trees. This result suggests that the distribution of Kamala trees is a good indicator of the presence of Asian elephants during the dry season in the Shivalik landscape. These findings may have major implications for the conservation of Asian elephants, especially in designing wildlife corridors and mitigating human-elephant conflicts. 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier B.V.","English","Animals;  Drought;  Probability;  Regression analysis;  Vegetation, Asian elephant;  Ecological niche modeling;  Indicator species;  Kamala tree;  Logistic regression models;  Probability of occurrence;  Receiver operating characteristic curves;  Species distribution modeling, Forestry, bioclimatology;  bioindicator;  conservation planning;  dry season;  ecological modeling;  elephant;  herbivore;  model validation;  nature conservation;  nature-society relations;  niche partitioning;  regression analysis;  spatial distribution;  species occurrence, India;  Siwalik Hills, Elephas maximus;  Mallotus philippensis","1470160X","10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.07.011",NA,NA,NA,NA,"239-247","Kamala Tree as an Indicator of the Presence of Asian Elephants During the Dry Season in the Shivalik Landscape of Northwestern India.","selected",NA,"excluded"

The study reported maximum stem density of (928 trees ha1) at the A2 altitude and minimum in the A3 and A1 with 600 trees ha1 each. The stem densities in relation to NDVIs were observed in the order N5 &gt; N3 &gt; N4 &gt; N1 &gt; N2 and did not show any definite trend with increasing altitude. Highest stem volume (295.7m3ha1) was observed in N1 NDVI and minimum (194.1m3ha1) in N3 index. The trend observed for stem biomass at different altitudes was A3 &gt; A1 &gt; A2 and for NDVIs, it was N5 &gt; N1 &gt; N4 &gt; N2 &gt; N3.

The relationship between soil carbon and other studied parameters was derived through different functions simultaneously. Cubic function showed highest r2 in most cases, followed by power, inverse and exponential function. The relationship with NDVI showed highest r2 (0.62) through cubic functions. In relationship between ecosystem carbon with other parameters of different altitudinal gradient and NDVI, only one positively significant relation was formed with total density (0.579) through cubic function.

Systematic sampling on the daily CO2 exchange process and biophysical parameters formed the basis of this investigation. The analyses based on year-round in-situ measurements showed that mean daily net canopy carbon exchange (net primary productivity) of the system (all species in totality) was 11.8 g C m-2 day-1 (41.5 t C ha-1yr-1). All species had almost equal contribution to the system NPP and they were in order of A. conyzoides (14.6 t C ha-1yr-1), B. biternata (13.8 t C ha-1yr-1) and L. camara (13.1 t C ha-1yr-1). Light use efficiency (LUE) exhibited a bimodal trend with peaks in early (Jun - Jul) and post-monsoon (Oct - Nov) season. Mean LUE of L. camara was 20.8 10.9 mmol CO2 mol-1 PAR, while that of A. conyzoides and B. biternata were 24.7 9.9 and 22.8 10.4 mmol CO2 mol-1 PAR, respectively.

To infer the potential and limitations of grass phytolith assemblages and indices to reconstruct vegetation vis--vis climate in the Himalayan mountain regions, we analyzed phytolith assemblages from 66 dominant grasses and 153 surface soils from four different forest types along the c. 130-4000 m a.s.l. elevation gradients in the Darjeeling and Arunachal Himalayas. Grass short cell phytolith assemblages from modern grasses show significant variability with rising elevation. To test the reliability of the above observation, phytoliths from the soil samples were subjected to linear discriminant analysis (DA). DA classified 85.3% and 92.3% of the sites to their correct forest zones in the Darjeeling and Arunachal Himalayas respectively. Relative abundance of bilobate, cross, short saddle, plateau saddle, rondel and trapeziform types allow discrimination of the phytolith assemblage along the elevation gradient. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) on the soil phytolith data further revealed their relationships with the climatic variables. Temperature and evapotranspiration were found to be the most influential for differential distribution of grass phytolith assemblages with rising elevation in the eastern Himalayas. We also tested the reliability of phytolith indices (Ic, Iph and Fs) for tracing the dominance of different grass subfamilies in the eastern Himalayas. Ic proved to be most reliable in discriminating C3/C4 grass along the elevation gradient while Iph and Fs proved to be less reliable. We observed that in the monsoon dominated eastern Himalayas, a little adjustment in Ic index may enhance the accuracy of interpretations.

The climate ranges from cold arid zone to temperate, subtropical temperate transitional, and low-altitude subtropical zone. The temperature regime ranges from cryic to hyperthermic and moisture regime from aridic cold in Greater Himalayas to humid in Lesser Himalayas and subhumid in Siwaliks. This tract is broadly divided in to three distinct landform units, i.e., Greater Himalayas, Lesser Himalayas, and Siwaliks. These units are subdivided into nine subunits. Soils of Greater Himalayas mostly pertain to Leh and Ladakh, Lahaul and Spiti, and high reaches of Uttarakhand. The moisture regime is cryic and temperature regime is aridic. These soils are coarse textured, nearly neutral to mildly alkaline, deep, low in organic matter, and base saturated. Flood plain of Indus river system is mostly calcareous, neutral to slightly alkaline. Some of high-altitude soils are classified as cryic Eutrochrepts or cryollic Eutrochrepts and typic Cryorthents and cryic Udifluvents. Soils under Lesser Himalayas cover the valley of Kashmir and Pir Panjal ranges in J&K comprising parts of the district of Punch, Rajouri, Udhampur, Doda, and Kishtwar of Jammu region and all the districts of Kashmir region. The soils of Lesser Himalayas are highly variable depending on the vegetation and geology of the area and physiography. They are mostly shallow to medium deep and deep, well to excessively drained, sandy, loamy-skeletal, coarse-loamy, and fine-loamy calcareous as well as noncalcareous soils. They are slightly acidic to neutral on high reaches and neutral to slightly alkaline on lower hills. The organic status of the soils is high to very high. They have been classified as lithic/typic Udorthents, typic/dystric Eutrochrepts, typic Hapludolls, and typic Udifluvents. Typic Hapludalfs are also reported in Lesser Himalayas of Kashmir region. Soils of Siwalik regions cover areas of southwestern part of Himalayas comprising Jammu region of J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab states. The soil-scape represents moderately to gently sloping situated in lower elements of topography comprising Hapludalfs, Hapludolls, and Eutrochrepts, whereas moderately to steeply sloping pediments at lower elevations are represented by Udorthents, Haplumbrepts, and Argudolls.

Murine rodents from the Miocene Siwalik Group of Pakistan have an excellent fossil record showing temporal trends of morphological change, and are therefore ideal to observe the process of lineage divergence as fossil evidence. Here, we review the evolution of Siwalik murine rodents in the sense of the general lineage concept and draw lines of evidence for lineage separation. For currently available datasets, we applied the initial split criterion as well as three operational criteria (phenetic, diagnosable and ecological properties). In early Siwalik murine rodents, the acquisition of distinct phenetic properties emerges subsequent to the event of the evolutionary split. The phenetic evidence occurs closer in time to true divergence, while distinct diagnosable and ecological properties fully arise later. Within a sequence of time-controlled samples, these observations explicitly show that phenetic properties (here, shape data and a combination of linear measurements) more precisely delimit the divergence of fossil species than does the fixation of diagnostic properties. 2016, 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","English","divergence;  fossil record;  Miocene;  paleontology;  rodent;  species concept, Pakistan, Murinae;  Rodentia","08912963","10.1080/08912963.2015.1022175","1-2",NA,NA,NA,"189-198","a Palaeontological Case Study for Species Delimitation in Diverging Fossil Lineages.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

Noticeable increase in temperature trends with a considerable variation during different seasons over the past quartile period has been noted. Much perceptible and significant variation among the mean minimum and mean maximum temperature in the northeastern and southwestern part of the district has been brought out. The exchanges between airflow and temperature across the hills, plains, and monsoon may significantly lead to variations in the microclimate. This is essential in predicting global and regional climate variations, because it determines the extent of human influence on the climate and makes sound projections about natural rhythm of changing climate as well as anthropogenic stimulus.

Ants were used as bioindicators to assess ecosystem health of the area. We measured diversity, community patterns, species composition and the influence of invasive species of Formicidae by collecting at 75 sites from 44 locations in three habitats: primary forest (PF), secondary forest (SF) and non-forest areas (NF) using six collection techniques. We obtained the most comprehensive dataset compiled for Indian ants to date (sample coverage 94 % to 97 %) and sampled 31,487 ant specimens, representing 181 species from 59 genera and 9 ant families. Thirty of the 59 genera were represented by a single species, 12 genera by more than five species and 26 species were new to science. Species richness differed significantly between habitats, with 151 in SF, 120 in PF and 110 in NF. Species richness rose with altitude and was influenced by precipitation, northern latitude and eastern longitude. As demonstrated by redundancy analysis and beta diversity, habitats also differed in species composition. Nineteen invasive/tramp species, comprising ca. 13% of total abundance, were distributed among the three habitats (including PF). Our findings point towards a disrupted, degraded ecosystem with high anthropogenic impact and reduced ecosystem health, even in the primary and protected forest areas. Invasive species pose a serious threat to the native species of Himalaya.

The forest stands along the altitudinal gradient were studied on 20 sampling plots of two sub zones of the Temperate and Subalpine zone. Tsuga dumosa was the ecologically most important species in the Upper and the Lower Subalpine zone with high important value index (IVI = 124.31). Quercus semecarpifolia and Lithocarpus elegans were the ecologically most important species in the Upper and the Lower Temperate zone with IVI of 66.64 and 46.39 respectively. Similarly, indicator species analysis was performed to know the preferences of tree species within the vegetation zones. Rhododendron campanulatum is highly significant (p < 0.001) and Tsuga dumosa significant (0.05 < p < 0.01) in the Upper Subalpine zone, whereas Rhododendron anthopogon prefers the Lower Subalpine zone with significant value (0.01 < p < 0.001). Only the Quercus semecarpifolia prefers the Upper Temperate zone. There was no specific trend in the structure along the altitudinal gradient. The Shannon diversity index ranged from 1.10 to 2.34 with the highest value in the Lower Temperate zone. Both Simpson index (0.89) and Evenness (0.86) were high in the Lower Temperate zone. From this study it is concluded that the contribution of forest composition in terms of species richness and Shannon diversity is significant in Lower Temperate zone. The Upper Subalpine zone has less diversity and may also be less endangered by human impact but may profit from climate change in the future. 2016, ALKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Corvinus University of Budapest","English",NA,"15891623","10.15666/aeer/1402_235251","2",NA,NA,NA,"235-251","Structure, Composition and Diversity of Forest along the Altitudinal Gradient in the Himalayas, Nepal.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

The IHR occupies the strategic position of the entire northern boundary (northwest to northeast) of the country and touches almost all the international borders of seven countries with India. The contribution of India is ~16% of total geographical area, out of which ~17% area is under permanent snow cover and ~35% is under seasonal snow cover. The IHR is responsible for providing water to a large part of the Indian subcontinent and contains varied flora and fauna; it was estimated that ~40 million of the population reside in this region. The Indian Himalayan rivers run off ~1,600,000 million m3 of water annually for drinking, irrigation, hydropower, etc. The IHR has been a potential source of important medicinal herbs and shrubs. This region is extremely rich in plant life and abounds in genetic diversity of all types of fauna and flora. The medicinal virtues of the northwest (NW) Himalayan plants are well known from the early times of the great epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata and are mentioned in the oldest Hindu scriptures, viz., Rigveda, which is said to be the source of the Ayurvedic medicine system. These high hills are the storehouse of numerous herbs and shrubs, which are exploited not only for the pharmaceutical industries worldwide. In fact, a large percentage of crude drugs in the Indian market come from this Himalayan region. Besides this, the Himalayan regions remain as a source of many cereal crops, pulses, vegetables, fruits, and animal husbandry. The climate change impact is at a global level, and this Himalayan region is no exception. Due to the climatic changes, a lot of disturbances happening like flooding, drought, wildfire, and other global changes derive from pollutions and overexploitation of resources.

Specifically, the objectives of this study are twofold: first, to quantify interannual trends in vegetation greenness by conducting nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend analysis on MODIS-NDVI time series (2000-2014) and, second, to assess distribution of this trend with respect to land use land cover properties and elevation zones. The results show that out of the total vegetated area in Uttarakhand, 2,686.95 km2 (5.69%) showed changes in the vegetation greenness and 73.64% of this change was significant negative trend (browning). While areas with <800 m elevation showed dominant browning, those between 800 and 1600 m showed significant positive trend (greening), and majority of areas >1600 m were characterized by browning trend. Majority of intensively cultivated irrigated croplands in the Himalayan foothills and areas around growing urban centers showed widespread browning, whereas areas of rainfed cultivation showed dominant greening. Browning was also dominant in closed needle leaf forests and alpine shrublands, except areas where human impacts has led to more mixed patterns.

We assessed the diversity and frequency of insect herbivory on 137 specimens representing the Darjeeling lower Siwalik flora (DLSF). We also examined the percent of leaf area removed by herbivory as an independent measure of the effect of insect herbivore removal of host plant photosynthetic tissue. Five functional feeding groups (FFGs) are identified in this study namely leaf mining, hole feeding, skeletonizing, galling and margin feeding. These traces indicate that insects interacted with the plants for various purposes, including feeding, egg laying and sheltering. Furthermore, these morphotraces tend to suggest similarities in insect interactions with leaves of extant plant species such as Persea, Woodfordia, Shorea, Artocarpus, Callicarpa, Albizia, Lagerstroemia etc. On the basis of comparison with extant taxa, possible leaf feeders could have belonged to the insect orders Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. Although the morphology of the phytophagous insects associated with the fossil leaves is unknown, present findings reveal that many modern plant-insect relationships were established by the Miocene time and continue to the present, shaping both the present day flora and fauna. In the present study we compare insect herbivory at DLSF to that of our previously investigated Arunachal lower Siwalik flora and two younger floras from that area.

Accurate LAI estimates of tropical deciduous forest are required in studies of regional and global change modeling. Tropical deciduous forest due to higher species richness, multiple species association, varied phenophases, irregular stem densities and basal cover, multistoried canopy architecture and different micro-climatic conditions offers dynamism to the understanding of the LAI dynamics of different PFTs in an ecosystem. This investigation reports a new indirect method for measurement of leaf area index (LAI) in a topical moist deciduous forest in Himalayan foothills using LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. We measured the LAI in two seasons (summer; leaf senescence stage and post-monsoon; full green stage) in three (dry miscellaneous, sal mixed and teak plantations) plant functional types (PFT) in Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, India. Ground LAI values ranged between 2.41 and 6.89, 1.17 and 7.71, and 1.92 and 5.19 during post-monsoon season and 1.36-4.49, 0.67-3.1 and 0.37-1.83 during summer season in dry miscellaneous, sal mixed and teak plantation, respectively. We observed strong correlation between LAI and community structural parameters (tree density, basal cover and species richness), with maximum with annual litter fall (R2 > 0.8) and aboveground biomass (AGB) (R2 > 0.75). We provided equations relating LAI with AGB, which can be utilized in future studies for this region and can be reasonably extrapolated to other regions with suitable statistical extrapolations. However, the relations between LAI and other parameters can be further improved with incorporation of data from optimized and seasonal sampling. Our indirect method of LAI estimation using litter fall as a proxy, offers repetitive potential for LAI estimate in other PFTs with relatively time and cost-effective way, thereby generating quicker and reliable data for model run for regional and global change studies. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Cassiope species grow as dwarf shrubs at high latitudes and high elevations. Unlike in the High Arctic, not much is known about their age and growth on the Tibetan Plateau and in the Himalayas. There, Cassiope fastigiata could potentially serve as indicator species for climate change. The objective of our study, therefore, was to investigate its dendroecological potential. For this purpose, 20 shoots were collected both on the south-eastern Tibetan Plateau (site 1) and in the central Himalayas (site 2). Cross-sections of 810m in thickness were cut and the widths of the clearly distinguishable growth rings were measured. No missing outer rings were detected at the shoot base when serial sectioning was applied. Of the 40 shoots, 19 at site 1 and 10 at site 2 showed similar growth patterns. The remaining shoots were excluded from further analyses. C. fastigiata formed up to 30 annual growth rings whose width varied from 13 to 150m. Its growth at both sites was positively associated with temperature in late winter/early spring, and at site 2 additionally with precipitation in late autumn of the preceding year and spring of the current year. Our study confirmed that C. fastigiata forms distinct annual growth rings. The growth response to precipitation at site 1 and the lack thereof at site 2 result from differences in hydrology between the south-eastern Tibetan Plateau and the central Himalayas. 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Springer Verlag","English","Forestry;  Springs (components), Dendroecology;  Growth rings;  High altitude;  Himalayas;  Tibetan Plateau;  Treeline, Climate change","09311890","10.1007/s00468-014-1128-5","1",NA,NA,NA,"79-86","The Alpine Dwarf Shrub Cassiope Fastigiata in the Himalayas: Does it Reflect Site-Specific Climatic Signals in Its Annual Growth Rings?","selected",NA,"excluded"

Specifically, data on livelihood vulnerability and responsive behavior is lacking. To address this gap the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has developed the Vulnerability and Adaptive Capacity Assessment (VACA), a research tool to explore livelihood vulnerability to environmental and socioeconomic change as well as adaptive capacity in the mountain context. As part of the Himalayan Climate Change Adaptation Programme (HICAP), ICIMOD has carried out a representative quantitative survey that interviewed about 6,100 households in three sub-basins in the HKH region: the Upper Indus sub-basin in Pakistan, the Eastern Brahmaputra sub-basin in India, and the Koshi sub-basin in Nepal. The chapter discusses the operationalization of vulnerability in the VACA questionnaires, the research design of the VACA survey, and first findings for the three sub-basins.

The study sites in each forest were classified into non-degraded, semi-degraded and degraded plots based on the intensity of current and past anthropogenic disturbance impacts. In B. utilis forest, density and basal area of trees, and density of herbs and shrubs decreased with increasing disturbance. In Acer mixed forest, the decrease was for density and basal area of trees, and density of herbs. However, in A. pindrow forest, density of trees was highest in the degraded plots and total basal area peaked in the semi-degraded plots. Natural regeneration, expressed in terms of seedling and sapling density in different forest types, revealed the following pattern: (i) in B. utilis forest, the highest density of seedlings and saplings was in semi-degraded plots; (ii) in A. pindrow and Acer mixed forests, the density of seedlings and saplings was highest in the degraded plots. The present study indicates that the compositional attributes of sub-alpine forest communities in western Himalaya are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances, and the effects varied amongst the forest types and life forms.

Over the last two decades, land transformation related to exploitative land uses is among the main drivers of changing vegetation cover and productivity in western Himalayas. In a region where field based research is challenging due to heterogenous relief and high altitude, quantifying changes in vegetation photosynthetic activity using remote sensing can provide essential information regarding trends in vegetation cover and its linkages with anthropogenic impacts. We conducted seasonal trend analysis (STA) on MODIS NDVI time-series data (2000-2014) over Uttarakhand Himalayas and examined spatio-temporal patterns in vegetation trends and its association with altitudinal gradient and land use land cover (LULC) dynamics. In STA the first step determines the annual mean and seasonal NDVI patterns and the second step analyzes the non-parametric trend in magnitude and timing of the annual mean and seasonal NDVI cycle. To provide insights on the role of changing land use to detected changes in vegetation trend, we linked MODIS derived trends to land transformation processes using multi-temporal high spatial resolution imagery in Google Earth (GE). In total 3286.82km2 (6.9% vegetated area of Uttarakhand) showed significant trend (p&lt;0.01) in mean annual greenness. While areas &lt;800m elevation showed dominant negative trend in mean annual greenness (browning)), those between 800 and 1600m showed mostly positive trend (greening) and majority of areas &gt;1600m were characterized by negative trend in mean annual greenness. Majority of intensively cultivated irrigated croplands in the Himalayan foothills as well as areas around growing urban centers showed widespread browning, which was contrastingly different from rainfed cultivation areas that showed dominant greening trend. Browning trend was observed to be consistent with increasing altitude, particularly in closed needle leaf forests and alpine shrublands, except areas where human impacts has led to more mixed patterns. Trends in the annual seasonal timing of NDVI indicated an earlier green-up for most parts of the Uttarakhand Himalayas. These results highlight fine scale spatial variations in seasonal vegetation trends and are in partial agreement with previous studies that report only increasing brownness detected at broader scale using much coarser spatial resolution time-series. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Elsevier Ltd","English","land cover;  land use;  MODIS;  NDVI;  remote sensing;  seasonal variation;  spatiotemporal analysis;  time series analysis;  trend analysis;  urbanization;  vegetation cover, Himalayas;  India;  Uttarakhand","01436228","10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.10.007",NA,NA,NA,NA,"29-41","Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Trends in Seasonal Vegetation Productivity Across Uttarakhand, Indian Himalayas, 2000-2014.","selected",NA,"selected"

Mountains greatest values may be as sources of all the world's major rivers, and those of the Himalayas are no less important in terms of provisioning the ecosystem services that have thus far sustained huge populations of people and high levels of biodiversity. The survival of these ecosystems and wildlife are now threatened by human activities such as timber harvesting, intensive grazing by livestock, tourism, industrialization, and agricultural expansion into forestlands, and, above all, climate change which has led to the invasion of many noxious weeds. The present study aimed to analyze the invasion status of one such noxious weed, lantana (Lantana camara), from the western Himalayan foothills. A total of 122 plant species were recorded as associates from all lantana infested sites comprising 73 shrubs, 39 herbs, five sedges, and three grasses belonging to 47 families. Fabaceae and Asteraceae were found to be the most dominant families growing generously with lantana. Significant site effect was frequently observed than effect due to invasion status. Soil samples were collected and analyzed from highly invaded and moderately invaded areas to see the relationship between soil physicochemical properties and lantana growth. Results of the present study show that factors such as pH, total nitrogen, soil organic carbon, phosphorus, and potassium contents are positively impelling lantana invasion in all the sites.

We tested if tree diversity and compositional heterogeneity of this ecosystem was higher than other sal-dominated forests due to moister environment. Methods: Vegetation was sampled in 11 transects of 10 m width and up to 500 m length covering 5.2 ha area. All stems 10 cm girth at breast height were enumerated. Results: We found a pattern of mixed dominance of Shorea robusta (sal) and Schima wallichii and co-dominance of Pinus kesiya and Careya arborea. The Shannons diversity index (H) was 3.395 nats. This value is remarkably high and competitive to that of moist sal forests of eastern Himalayan foothills and sal-dominated forests of Tripura. A high value of H was manifested by: a) high species richness (S = 123), b) good equitability (70.6%), c) fair resource apportionment, and d) abundance of rare species (84% species with less than one per cent of total individuals, 67% species with two or less individuals ha1 and 59% species with one or less individuals ha1). The compositional heterogeneity was fair (Whittakers w = 3.15). The presence of Fagaceae with six species commanding 4.3% of importance value (IVI) and of a pine (P. kesiya) in sal forest was remarkable. As many as 58 species showed low density ( 10 individuals ha1), uniform dispersion, five species achieved higher density (&gt; 10 individuals ha1), uniform dispersion and six of the top 10 species were clumped. The forest showed an exponential demographic curve illustrating good regeneration of an expanding community. Vertical stratification was simple with a poor canopy and fair subcanopy, which together with low basal area (15.65 m2 ha1 for individuals 10 cm gbh) indicated logging of mature sal trees in the past. Conclusions: The Khasi hill sal forest ecosystem is richer in alpha and beta diversity than most sal-dominated forests, but past logging has reduced basal area. Selective removal of small timber and firewood, slash-and-burn agriculture and recurrent burning of forest floor are the principal anthropogenic factors controlling forest structure and regeneration of species. 2014 Tripathi and Shankar.","SpringerOpen","English",NA,"20956355","10.1186/s40663-014-0023-2","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Patterns of Species Dominance, Diversity and Dispersion in Khasi Hill Sal Forest Ecosystem in Northeast India.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

Unlike pedogenic carbonates, their stable isotope ratios lack investigations for paleoclimatic reconstructions. The present investigation therefore, explores the possibility of use of stable isotope studies of non-pedogenic carbonates from the Mio-Pleistocene Siwalik Group of sediments exposed in the Ramnagar sub-basin of the NW Himalaya. Petrographic studies reveal the dominance of micrite fabric in carbonate nodules both of pedogenic and non-pedogenic samples irrespective of specific stratigraphic unit. However, calcite as cement in the sandstones shows the dominance of micrite fabric in the younger in age sediments. Seventy-two non-pedogenic carbonate samples from the carbonate nodules and cement in the Siwalik sandstones, ranging in age between ~1Ma and 12.2Ma, were analyzed for 13C and 18O values. The 13C values vary from -24.77 to -1.1 and 18O values vary from -15.34 to -7.81. Pedogenic and non-pedogenic carbonates ranging in age between ~1Ma and 6Ma have largely similar 13C values and the range of 13C values indicate the dominance of C4 type of vegetation. However, unlike pedogenic carbonates which showed the dominance of C3 type of vegetation pre- 7Ma on the basis of 13C -depleted isotopic values (Singh et al., 2011), 13C values are largely enriched in the corresponding aged non-pedogenic carbonates revealing no information on specific type of vegetation. Likewise, paleoprecipitational reconstructions from 18O values in pedogenic carbonates showed a progressive increase in aridity from ~12Ma to recent excluding short term increases in rainfall/monsoon intensity at around 10Ma, 5Ma, and 1.8Ma (Singh et al., 2012). On the contrary, such reconstructions are not possible from the 18O values of non-pedogenic carbonates and indeed the 18O values of non-pedogenic carbonates are largely depleted to as much as 6 from the corresponding pedogenic carbonates. Such differences in 13C and 18O values of non-pedogenic carbonates from pedogenic carbonates are primarily due to the dependence of the former on groundwater conditions responsible for precipitating carbonate. Further, a comparison of isotopic values between non-pedogenic and pedogenic carbonates can be interpreted that post-6Ma and pre-6Ma non-pedogenic carbonates were largely formed by shallow and deep groundwater conditions respectively. The result of these investigative studies therefore, suggests that the stable 13C and 18O values of non-pedogenic carbonates, unlike the pedogenic carbonates and irrespective of nature of calcite fabric, showed their little importance in paleoclimatic and paleoecological reconstructions. 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier","English","carbonate;  climate variation;  foreland basin;  paleoclimate;  paleoecology;  pedogenesis;  petrogenesis;  Pleistocene;  sandstone;  stable isotope, Siwalik Hills","00310182","10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.02.002",NA,NA,NA,NA,"363-372","Do Stable Isotopes in Carbonate Cement of Mio-Pleistocene Himalayan Sediments Record Paleoecological and Paleoclimatic Changes?","unknown",NA,"excluded"

Two lower Siwalik mid Miocene floras yielded almost the same values suggesting mean annual temperatures (MATs) of 25.4 and 25.3 C 2.8 C (all uncertainties 2 sigma) with warm month mean temperatures (WMMTs) of 28.4 and 27.8 3.39 C and cold month mean temperatures (CMMTs) of 17.9 and 21.3 4 C.

The results were compared with the best available sources for lakes and wetlands on global and national scales. It was demonstrated that the method could extract wetlands automatically to a reasonable degree of accuracy and, therefore, reduce the need for extensive ground knowledge. The model was transferred by adjusting parameters through application of high-resolution satellite data (Landsat) in some sub-basin areas.

Our data represent the biogeography of the northern Indian subcontinent, but because neighboring areas of similar age are not as well known, virtually all species are found only there, and the proportion of the fauna that is immigrant is not apparent. We use preceding faunal assemblages to judge whether individual species might have originated there.

In the late middle Miocene both groups show stability, with a high proportion of long-term residents, and high endemism among rodents.

They are continually interacting under the infl uence of climate and of peoples activities (Hudson 1995). Land-use/cover changes have recently become a major issue of research and a debate among academicians, researchers, policy makers and governments. Land use stands for the pattern of mans activity or economic function on a piece of land and land cover changes relate to the type of feature changes on the surface of the Earth (Lillesand and Kiefer 1994). It is the result of anthropogenic interaction with the natural environment. Besides affecting the quality of life of the people living in the area, land-cover changes also affects surface run-off as also erosion intensity (Piyoosh 2002). With increase in population and thus, in human settlements, urbanization, and industrialization, the change in all categories of land use seems to have led to tremendous changes in landscape. Similar to the global scenario, mountain regions have also been characterized by land-cover changes. In many of the mountain areas, expansion of human settlements and agricultural land over the marginal mountain niche is becoming very common which has resulted in shrinking of forestland. Population growth has forced the local people to bring more land under cultivation (Rawat et al. 1996). Depletion of forest from the fragile landscape of mountain has led to environmental hazards in the forms of landslides, debris fl ow, mass movement and fl ash fl ood. Musudiar (1993), Ukhimath [(Chamoli District), and Mapla (Pithoragarh District) (both in 1998)] landslides were the consequences of forest depletion which resulted in heavy damage to the property and loss of life. In the Central Himalaya, existing land-use pattern is a result of centuries old practices. Forestland occupies the highest geographical area (above 65%) while agricultural land is limited (12%). Cropping pattern is dominated by the practices of traditional subsistence cereal farming mainly millets. Currently, this pattern has changed as the populace of the region has largely migrated to the urban areas in search of better livelihood. Non-availability of agricultural land, unsuitability, and instability of terrain, harsh environmental conditions and inaccessibility of forestland are other aspects, which affect the landuse/cover changes (Sati and Kumar 2004). This study reveals that high population growth rate was observed in the Kewer Gadhera sub-watershed, increase in forestland and decrease in agricultural land was also observed during the last four decades. It was mainly due to the large-scale emigration on the one hand and land abandonment on the other. The main objective of this chapter is to examine land-use/cover changes during the last four decades in the Kewer Gadhera. 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","CRC Press","English",NA,NA,"10.1201/b17963",NA,NA,NA,NA,"298-311","Land-Use/Cover Changes in the Kewer Gadhera Sub-Watershed, Central Himalaya.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

A geospatial modeling approach based on a global environmental stratification is used to explore potential impacts of projected climate change on the spatial distribution of bioclimatic strata and ecoregions within the transboundary Kailash Sacred Landscape (KSL) of China, India and Nepal. Twenty-eight strata, comprising seven bioclimatic zones, were aggregated to develop an ecoregional classification of 12 ecoregions (generally defined by their potential dominant vegetation type), based upon vegetation and landcover characteristics. Projected climate change impacts were modeled by reconstructing the stratification based upon an ensemble of 19 Earth System Models (CIMP5) across four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) emission scenarios (i.e. 63 impact simulations), and identifying the change in spatial distribution of bioclimatic zones and ecoregions. Large and substantial shifts in bioclimatic conditions can be expected throughout the KSL area by the year 2050, within all bioclimatic zones and ecoregions. Over 76 % of the total area may shift to a different stratum, 55 % to a different bioclimatic zone, and 36.6 % to a different ecoregion.

High temperatures, combined with heavy to very heavy rains, have stimulated the growth of forests at lower levels.

Dipterocarpus macrocarpus (Hollong in Assamese) and Mesua ferrea (Nahar in Assamese) are the principal type trees of Assam valley tropical evergreen forests. In the tropical moist deciduous forests, Shorea robusta is the principal species with several associates like Schima wallichii (Makna Sal). The subtropical wet hill forests, as in Meghalaya, have several varieties of oak (Quercus spp.). Richness of flora because of the wet hills presents a climate condition, which combines the characteristics of tropical as well as temperate climate. At higher altitudes, mixed coniferous and coniferous forests occur followed by sub-alpine pastures, rhododendrons and scrubs at still higher altitudes. North-East India is known for its biodiversity. It is one of the two biodiversity hotspots of India. Half the total number of floral species, known in India, occurs here, and the region forms the richest reservoir of genetic variability. An important aspect of the forests of the region is the profusion of orchids. The North-East region has 876 orchid species, which constitute 70 % of the total orchid flora of India. To preserve the biodiversity of the region, a number of biospheres, national parks and wildlife sanctuaries (2004) are established in the region.

The cytological investigations of these species over a period of three years revealed new and varied chromosome numbers for 100 species globally and 50 species in India, making a substantial addition to the knowledge of the genera to which these species belong. To obtain a comprehensive cytological picture of each of these genera, chromosomal data have been updated by compiling the literature on previous chromosomal numbers and supplementing it from the present studies. The final form is now ready to show the status both at global and Indian levels for various parameters like total number of taxonomically known species, number of cytologically determined species along with intraspecifically added number of cytological taxa, presently inferred basic numbers, level and frequency of polyploids, and information on number of species per genus carrying inter- and intraspecific euploid and aneuploid variability at the genus level. Of the total 127 genera, 39 genera have 75% or more cytologically worked out species. Addition of cytotypes in many cytologically known species has resulted in an enhanced number of chromosomal races/cytological taxa over such species, in the majority of genera, justifying the ever growing need to make population based intensive studies of any plant species. The data show that monobasic and dibasic genera are less common than tribasic and polybasic ones. Genera with x = 8 are most common, followed by x = 7 and x = 6. Of 127 genera, 47 genera exhibit polyploidy of up to 25%; 22 genera have 26-50%; 15 genera have 51-70%; and 26 genera have 76-100% polyploidy, while 17 genera lack polyploidy altogether. Interspecific and/or intraspecific euploid cytotypes such as diploids plus polyploids or with ""polyploid series"" are present in most of the 107 genera. Intraspecific aneuploid chromosome numbers are also shown by 100 genera. Since these genera belong to different families, so no generalization can be made at family level. However, at genus level chromosomal observations show the active role of various evolutionary processes responsible for chromosomal diversity in the majority of these genera distributed in the Western Himalayas of India. 2014 2014 Dipartimento di Biologia Evoluzionistica, Universit di Firenze.","University of Florence","English",NA,"00087114","10.1080/00087114.2013.856088","1",NA,NA,NA,"1-24","An Overview of Chromosome and Basic Numbers Diversity in Cytologically Investigated Polypetalous Genera from the Western Himalayas (India)","unknown",NA,"excluded"

Bushmint is rapidly invading tropical ecosystems across the world, including India, and is major threat to native biodiversity, ecosystems and livelihoods. Knowledge about the likely areas under bushmint invasion has immense importance for taking rapid response and mitigation measures. In the present study, we model the potential invasion range of bushmint in India and investigate prediction capabilities of two popular species distribution models (SDM) viz., MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) and GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production). We compiled spatial layers on 22 climatic and non-climatic (soil type and land use land cover) environmental variables at India level and selected least correlated 14 predictor variables. 530 locations of bushmint along with 14 predictor variables were used to predict bushmint distribution using MaxEnt and GARP. We demonstrate the relative contribution of predictor variables and species-environmental linkages in modeling bushmint distribution. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess each model's performance and robustness. GARP had a relatively lower area under curve (AUC) score (AUC: 0.75), suggesting its lower ability in discriminating the suitable/unsuitable sites. Relative to GARP, MaxEnt performed better with an AUC value of 0.86. Overall the outputs of MaxEnt and GARP matched in terms of geographic regions predicted as suitable/unsuitable for bushmint in India, however, predictions were closer in the spatial extent in Central India and Western Himalayan foothills compared to North-East India, Chottanagpur and Vidhayans and Deccan Plateau in India. 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier","English","biological invasion;  dicotyledon;  ecological modeling;  environmental gradient;  genetic algorithm;  invasive species;  maximum entropy analysis;  niche;  weed, India","15749541","10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.04.002",NA,NA,NA,NA,"36-43","Modeling Potential Invasion Range of Alien Invasive Species, Hyptis Suaveolens (L.)

Effects of climate change on forests depend on ecosystem-specific factors including dimensions of climate (temperature, precipitation, drought, wind etc.). Available information is not sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the ecological, social and economic consequences. The present study assessed shifts in forest cover types of Western Himalayan Eco-region (700-4500 m). 100 randomly selected samples (75 for training and 25 for testing the model), genetic algorithm of rule set parameters and climatic envelopes were used to assess the distribution of five prominent forest cover types (Temperate evergreen, Tropical semi-evergreen, Temperate conifer, Subtropical conifer, and Tropical moist deciduous forests). Modelling was conducted for four different scenarios, current scenario, changed precipitation (8% increase), changed temperature (1. 07C increase), and both changed temperature and precipitation. On increasing precipitation a downward shift in the temperate evergreen and tropical semi-evergreen was observed, while sub-tropical conifer and tropical moist-deciduous forests showed a slight upward shift and temperate conifer showed no shift. On increasing temperature, an upward shift in all forest types was observed except sub-tropical conifer forests without significant changes. When both temperature and precipitation were changed, the actual distribution was maintained and slight upward shift was observed in all the forest types except sub-tropical conifer. It is important to understand the likely impacts of the projected climate change on the forest ecosystems, so that better management and conservation strategies can be adopted for the biodiversity and forest dependent community.

Such contiguity cannot be guaranteed without providing a path or 'a corridor' through forested landscapes that includes natural land cover and undisturbed patches. Incidentally, the Himalayan foothills have greater pressure on these landscapes due to high human dependence for livelihood. This pressure is expected to increase in the coming years altering the potential corridors between PAs. The PA managers need flexible processing, modeling and decision tools to propose a range of acceptable corridors between the PAs and ensure their sustainable health. Such flexible tools can be utilized in future to modify for taking decision to conserve the patches connecting patches and adapt as per changing landscapes. This article describes utility of geospatial modeling tools to assess the status of corridors in light of changing landscapes between Rajaji and Jim Corbett National Park, the two most important PAs in the Himalayan foothills.

The traditional medical systems of northern India are part of a time tested culture and honored still by people today. These traditional systems have been curing complex disease for more than 3,000 years. With rapidly growing demand for these medicinal plants, most of the plant populations have been depleted, indicating a lack of ecological knowledge among communities using the plants. Thus, an attempt was made in this study to focus on the ecological status of ethnomedicinal plants, to determine their availability in the growing sites, and to inform the communities about the sustainable exploitation of medicinal plants in the wild.Methods: The ecological information regarding ethnomedicinal plants was collected in three different climatic regions (tropical, sub-tropical and temperate) for species composition in different forest layers. The ecological information was assessed using the quadrate sampling method. A total of 25 quadrats, 10 10 m were laid out at random in order to sample trees and shrubs, and 40 quadrats of 1 1 m for herbaceous plants. In each climatic region, three vegetation sites were selected for ecological information; the mean values of density, basal cover, and the importance value index from all sites of each region were used to interpret the final data. Ethnomedicinal uses were collected from informants of adjacent villages. About 10% of inhabitants (older, experienced men and women) were interviewed about their use of medicinal plants. A consensus analysis of medicinal plant use between the different populations was conducted.Results: Across the different climatic regions a total of 57 species of plants were reported: 14 tree species, 10 shrub species, and 33 herb species. In the tropical and sub-tropical regions, Acacia catechu was the dominant tree while Ougeinia oojeinensis in the tropical region and Terminalia belerica in the sub-tropical region were least dominant reported. In the temperate region, Quercus leucotrichophora was the dominant tree and Pyrus pashia the least dominant tree. A total of 10 shrubs were recorded in all three regions: Adhatoda vasica was common species in the tropical and sub-tropical regions however, Rhus parviflora was common species in the sub-tropical and temperate regions. Among the 33 herbs, Sida cordifolia was dominant in the tropical and sub-tropical regions, while Barleria prionitis the least dominant in tropical and Phyllanthus amarus in the sub-tropical region. In temperate region, Vernonia anthelmintica was dominant and Imperata cylindrica least dominant. The consensus survey indicated that the inhabitants have a high level of agreement regarding the usages of single plant. The index value was high (1.0) for warts, vomiting, carminative, pain, boils and antiseptic uses, and lowest index value (0.33) was found for bronchitis.Conclusion: The medicinal plants treated various ailments. These included diarrhea, dysentery, bronchitis, menstrual disorders, gonorrhea, pulmonary affections, migraines, leprosy. The ecological studies showed that the tree density and total basal cover increased from the tropical region to sub-tropical and temperate regions. The species composition changed with climatic conditions. Among the localities used for data collection in each climatic region, many had very poor vegetation cover. The herbaceous layer decreased with increasing altitude, which might be an indication that communities at higher elevations were harvesting more herbaceous medicinal plants, due to the lack of basic health care facilities. Therefore, special attention needs to be given to the conservation of medicinal plants in order to ensure their long-term availability to the local inhabitants. Data on the use of individual species of medicinal plants is needed to provide an in-depth assessment of the plants availability in order to design conservation strategies to protect individual species. 2011 Kumar et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"English","Acacia catechu;  Barleria prionitis;  Desmodium oojeinense;  Hedera;  Imperata cylindrica;  Justicia;  Justicia adhatoda;  Phyllanthus amarus;  Pyrus;  Pyrus pashia;  Quercus leucotrichophora;  Rhus parviflora;  Sida cordifolia;  Terminalia bellirica;  Vernonia;  Vernonia anthelmintica, plant extract, article;  attitude to health;  biodiversity;  biomass;  climate;  ecology;  environmental protection;  ethnobotany;  female;  human;  India;  male;  medicinal plant;  phytotherapy;  traditional medicine, Biodiversity;  Biomass;  Climate;  Conservation of Natural Resources;  Ecology;  Ethnobotany;  Female;  Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;  Humans;  India;  Male;  Medicine, Traditional;  Phytotherapy;  Plant Extracts;  Plants, Medicinal","17464269","10.1186/1746-4269-7-32",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ethnomedicinal and Ecological Status of Plants in Garhwal Himalaya, India.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

Phenology is one of the tools that may indicate changing patterns. The paper focuses on the phenological pattern of alpine/sub-alpine species Aconitum heterophyllum, a high-value medicinal herb of the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR), a global hotspot and known to be sensitive to climatic change. In all 117 herbarium specimens of the species collected from three provinces (Western Himalaya, North West Himalaya and Trans Himalaya) of the region were recorded. Historic herbarium records (1848-2003) were analyzed to predict the flowering patterns using Generalized Additive Model (GAM) in view of complexity in the herbarium-based data structure. GAM indicated that the flowering time responded significantly, 26 days earlier per 1,000 m (P < 0.02). Likewise, the model showed significantly earlier flowering (17-25 days) during the last 100 years (P < 0.01). Moreover, maximum temperature of winter (December-February) explained increasing trends at both elevations (lower and mid) and mean winter temperature influenced the early flowering time (19-27 days) with an increase of 1C. The overall early flowering of A. heterophyllum may perhaps be considered as indicator of climate change; however, more datasets of herbarium records are required to further strengthen this premise. This study was undertaken to show that herbarium records could be utilized as a potential resource for assessing climate change using GAM. 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",NA,"English","alpine environment;  climate change;  complexity;  data set;  dicotyledon;  elevation;  flowering;  herb;  herbarium;  medicinal plant;  phenology;  specimen bank;  temperature effect, Himalayas;  India, Aconitum;  Aconitum heterophyllum","09603115","10.1007/s10531-011-0082-4","10",NA,NA,NA,"2201-2210","Potential of Herbarium Records to Sequence Phenological Pattern: a Case Study of Aconitum Heterophyllum in the Himalaya.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

Results of a long-term (32 years) experiment in the Indian Himalayas under rainfed soybean (Glycine max L.)- wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation was analyzed to determine the effects of mineral fertilizer and farmyard manure (FYM) application at 10 Mg ha-1 on SOC stocks and depth distribution of the labile and recalcitrant pools of SOC. Results indicate all treatments increased SOC contents over the control. The annual application of NPK significantly (P &lt; 0. 05) enhanced total SOC, oxidizable soil organic C and its fractions over the control plots. The increase in these SOC fractions was greater with the NPK + FYM treatment.

This study appraises the changes in soil properties over the course of a year (spring, summer, autumn, winter) for forest, grassland, and arable soils in a typical hilly and mountainous region of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. Soil samples were collected from major land-cover types in the mountain region: natural forest, grassland, and cultivated land (arable). The natural forest served as a control against which changes in soil properties resulting from removal of natural vegetation and cultivation of soil were assessed. Soil samples were collected from depths of 0-15 and 15-30 cm six times during the year and examined for changes in temperature, moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), micronutrients [iron, manganese, copper, and zinc (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, respectively)], and microbial population. Significant differences were found in soil temperature, soil moisture, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and number of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi among the three land-cover types. Soil under cultivation had 4-5 C higher temperature and 3-6% lower moisture than the adjacent soils under grassland and forest. Electrical conductivity (EC) values of forest, grassland, and arable soil were 0.36, 0.30, and 0.31 dS m-1, indicating that soil collected from the forest had 18-20% more EC than the adjacent arable and grassland soils. On average, amounts of Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn in the soil collected from the arable site were 6.6, 5.7, 1.7, and 0.8 mg kg-1, compared with 24.0, 12.1, 3.5, and 1.2 mg kg-1 soil in the forest soil, showing that arable had two to four times less micronutrients than grassland and forest.

Results of a long-term (30 year) experiment in the Indian Himalayas under rainfed soybean (Glycine max L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation was analyzed to determine the influence of mineral fertilizer and farmyard manure (FYM) application at 10 Mg ha-1 on SOC and total soil nitrogen (TSN) stocks and distribution within different aggregate size fractions. Fertilizers (NP, NK and NPK) and FYM in combination with N or NPK were applied before the soybean crop every year and no nutrient was applied before the wheat crop. Results showed that addition of FYM with N or NPK fertilizers increased SOC and TSN contents. The overall gain in SOC in the 0- to 45-cm soil depth interval in the plots under NPK+FYM treatment over NPK was 17.18 Mg Cha-1 in 30 year. The rate of conversion of input C to SOC was about 19% of each additional Mg C input per hectare. SOC content in large size aggregates was greater than in smaller size aggregates, and declined with decreased aggregate size.

Our analysis is evaluated against in situ observations to better understand the error characteristics of and to corroborate much of the space-time variability found within the MISR aerosol properties. The space-time variability is discussed in terms of aerosol sources, meteorology, and topography. We introduce indices based on aerosol size- and shape-segregated optical depth and their effect on AE that describe the relative seasonal change in anthropogenic and natural aerosols from the preceding season. Examples of major new findings include the following: (1) winter to premonsoon changes in aerosol properties are not just dominated by an increase in dust, as previously thought, but also by an increase in anthropogenic components, particularly in regions where biomass combustion is prevalent; (2) 15% of the AOD over the high wintertime pollution in the eastern Indo-Gangetic basin is due to large dust particles, resulting in the lowest AE (<0.8) over India in this season and likely caused by rural activities (e.g., agriculture, etc.) from the densely populated rural area; (3) while AOD decreases from the Indo-Gangetic basin up to the Tibetan Plateau, a large peak in AE and the fraction of AOD due to particle radii <0.7 m exists in the foothills of the Himalayas, particularly in the premonsoon season; and (4) the AOD due to nonspherical particles exhibits a strong ocean-to-land gradient over all seasons because of topographical and meteorological controls.

The total number of species at a regional scale drops substantially above the forest-line in the central Himalayas of Nepal. This study tests the effect of a forest border ecotone on a local scale using a grain size of 100 m2. We sampled a set of vertical transects across a sloping sub-alpine forest line where canopy and temperature covary, and a set of horizontal transects across a forest ecotone where there was no altitudinal difference to eliminate the influence of temperature. Detrended correspondence analysis revealed a continuous change in species composition across the forest border ecotone. Species turnover was, in general, low, and species richness did not vary very much between the forest and open landscapes. We attribute this to the grazing and browsing pressure in the area, which may have lowered the tree line. A reduced tree line compared to the climatic limit may facilitate enhanced species richness above the forest line. There was no significant difference in species richness between forest and open landscapes along horizontal transects where temperature variations were minimized. This study exemplifies the difficulties encountered on a local scale when one aims to test diversity hypotheses deduced from general models on forest-ecotone effect and mass effect. The low species turnover and minor differences in alpha diversity may be because the area is a cultural landscape and the homogenizing effect of domestic animals overrides some of the edge effects of the ecotone.

We investigated whether the decline of hornbills has affected the dispersal and recruitment of 3 large-seeded tree species. We hypothesized that 2 low-fecundity tree species, Chisocheton paniculatus and Dysoxylum binectariferum (Meliaceae) bearing arillate fruits, are more dispersal limited than a prolifically fruiting drupaceous tree Polyalthia simiarum (Annonaceae), which has potential dispersers other than hornbills. We estimated the abundance of large avian frugivores during the fruiting season along transects in 2 protected and 2 disturbed forests. We compared recruitment of the tree species near (<10 m) and far (10-40 m) from parent trees at protected and disturbed sites. Median abundance of Great (Buceros bicornis), Wreathed (Aceros undulatus), and Oriental Pied Hornbills (Anthracoceros albirostris) were significantly lower in disturbed forests, but sites did not differ in abundances of the Mountain Imperial Pigeon (Ducula badia). Overall, tree species showed more severely depressed recruitment of seedlings (77% fewer) and juveniles (69% fewer) in disturbed than in protected forests. In disturbed forests, 93% fewer seedlings of C. paniculatus were beyond parental crowns, and a high number of all seedlings (42%) accumulated directly under reproductive adults. In contrast, D. binectariferum and P. simiarum were recruitment rather than dispersal limited, with fewer dispersed seedlings surviving in disturbed than in protected forests. Results are consistent with the idea that disturbance disrupts mutualisms between hornbills and some large-seeded food plants, with the caveat that role redundancy within even small and specialized disperser assemblages renders other tree species less vulnerable to loss of regular dispersal agents. 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.",NA,"English","abundance;  bird;  deciduous tree;  fecundity;  hunting;  population decline;  recruitment (population dynamics);  seed dispersal, analysis of variance;  animal;  article;  bird;  growth, development and aging;  India;  Meliaceae;  physiology;  population dynamics;  reproduction;  seed dispersal;  seedling;  species difference;  symbiosis;  tree, Analysis of Variance;  Animals;  Birds;  India;  Meliaceae;  Population Dynamics;  Reproduction;  Seed Dispersal;  Seedling;  Species Specificity;  Symbiosis;  Trees, Asia;  Eurasia;  Himalayas;  India;  South Asia, Aceros undulatus;  Annonaceae;  Anthracoceros albirostris;  Aves;  Buceros bicornis;  Chisocheton;  Columba;  Ducula badia;  Dysoxylum;  Meliaceae;  Polyalthia","08888892","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01155.x","3",NA,NA,NA,"710-718","Recruitment of Hornbill-Dispersed Trees in Hunted and Logged Forests of the Indian Eastern Himalaya.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

The bright red color of the palaeosol beds has been earlier interpreted as a result of hot and arid palaeoclimate. However, as against this view, our investigations of the bright red palaeosol beds of the Lower Siwaliks suggest that the climate was cool and subhumid, instead of hot and arid during the deposition of these beds. Since cold climate is not very conducive to impart red coloration, further research is needed to explain the cause of these red beds. For this, the micromorphological study of soil thin sections was done which showed the presence of features such as dissolution and recrystallisation of quartz, feldspar and mica, compaction, slickensides, presence of calcite spars, subrounded and cracked nature of quartz grains, microfabric, complex patterns of birefringence fabrics, pigmentary ferric oxides, thick cutans and cementation by calcite. These features indicate that diagenesis took place on a large scale in these sediments. The positive Eh and neutral-alkaline pH of soils also suggest that the conditions were favorable for the formation of diagenetic red beds. During burial diagenesis of sediments, the hydroxides of ferromagnesian minerals got converted into ferric oxide minerals (hematite). During deep burial diagenesis smectite was converted into illite and the preponderance of illite over smectite with increasing depth of burial also indicates the diagenesis of sediments. Thus, the red color of the Lower Siwalik palaeosols seems to be due mainly to the burial diagenesis of sediments and does not appear to be due to the then prevailing climatic condition.

One such extreme precipitation event was recorded in Pakistan that produced 620 mm rainfall in the capital during only 10 h. Diagnostic analysis and numerical simulations have been carried out using surface and NCEP reanalysis data along with radar and satellite images for the development of a mesoscale convective system (MCS) resulting in a severe storm. It has been revealed that the sudden evolution of the MCS was the direct result of strong surface convection in moist and unstable lower layers of the atmosphere. The subsequent rapid development was the combined effect of the presence of a mid-latitude trough in the westerlies in the north and a moisture supply through monsoonal flow along the Himalaya. The westward shifting of the sub-tropical high from the north of India, and the strong divergence zone on its east edge played a significant role in developing the upward motion. Movement of the system was controlled by the steering current in the middle troposphere. The model captured the location of heavy precipitation well at 15 and 30 km resolution but failed to predict the amount of rainfall.

Realizing the importance and potential impact of climate change on natural resources and population and their sustainable development, several projects have been initiated in collaboration with international institutions such as APN, ICIMOD, UNEP, START, and others. The focus of these initiatives is on the impact of climate change on various components of the complex system such as water resources, ecology, agriculture, socio-economics, and others. So far these activities have been centered on the resource inventories/vulnerability assessment and identification of potential threats based on which coping mechanisms could be identified and policy recommendations could be formulated. Using historical climatic data it has been concluded that since 1931 in general the extreme temperatures in the arid environments have increased while in sub-humid and humid environments these have been decreased.

There is now a general scientific consensus about the veracity of these predictions and a growing societal awareness that global warming is the most vexing environmental issue facing the planet. The newly released IPCC summary for policy makers (IPCC, 2007) concludes that the radiative forcing due to the increase in the greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, tropospheric ozone, and several halo carbons) from the pre-industrial to the year 2004 is about 3 W/m2 area of the earth's surface. The energy added to the planet by this radiative forcing is equivalent to burning 25 trillion light bulbs (thousand billion bulbs distributed around the planet) of 60-W power each, every second of the day and night, throughout the year. What is less recognized, however, is a comparably major global problem dealing with air pollution. New data have revealed that, due to fast long-range transport, trans-oceanic plumes of atmospheric brown clouds (ABCs) containing tiny particles intercept sunlight, cause surface dimming, cool the surface, warm the air and disrupt regional rainfall patterns and lead to large-scale drying (Ramanathan et al., 2005, 2007; also see http://www-abc-asia.ucsd.edu/). For the Indian sub-continent and the adjacent N Indian Ocean including Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, it has been shown (Ramanathan et al., 2001) that the brown clouds from S and SE Asia have decreased the solar radiation at the surface by about 7% (for the 6 month long dry season) and increased atmospheric solar heating by as much as 50%. When the observationally constrained 3-dimensional radiative forcing by the brown clouds was introduced into a coupled ocean-atmosphere model, it led to a deceleration of the summer monsoon circulation and helped account for the observed reduction of 5-7% in the summer rainfall since the 1950s (Ramanathan et al., 2005). The primary mechanism, as discussed in Ramanathan et al. (2005), is that the dimming by brown clouds suppressed the sea surface temperatures in the N Indian Ocean from responding to the greenhouse warming; whereas, south of the equator (where the brown cloud effects are minimal) the sea surface warmed by as much as 0.7 K since the 1950s. The net effect is a reduction in the north-south sea surface temperature gradient which in turn led to a deceleration of the monsoon circulation. This finding has since been confirmed by two other independent studies (Lau et al. in this issue; and another by Meehl et al., submitted). The simulated reduction in rainfall was incorporated in an Agro-economic model by Aufhammer et al. (2006). This first study of its kind, demonstrated that the effect of greenhouse warming on minimum temperatures, when combined with reduction in rainfall by brown clouds, have decreased rice production in Indian by as much as 14% since the 1950s. The important aspect of this finding is that the rate of growth of rice harvest in India has slowed down considerably (from over 3% in the 1960s to less than 1% now). The Aufhammer et al. study provides an explanation for this anomalous behavior. GHGs on the other hand, warm the surface and the atmosphere and make the planet wetter with correlative effects, such as melting of glaciers and altering the strengths of storms, among others. New studies (Chung et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2006), using observationally constrained aerosol observations, have clearly shown that anthropogenic aerosols (i.e., brown clouds) have led to a global averaged dimming of about 3-5 W/m2, as of 2000-2003. There is a comparably large atmospheric solar heating, and the sum of the two, the radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere, is about -0.6 to -2.7 W/m2. It now seems that the surface cooling effect of ABCs may have masked as much as 50% of the global warming due to GHGs. This presents a dilemma for the global community because efforts to curb air pollution, which has to happen to mitigate their negative effects on human health and the eco-system, may unmask the ABC cooling effect and could lead to a large amplification of the surface warming in the coming decades. On the other hand, if GHGs are curbed due to concerns about global warming, which also has to happen in view of their large global negative impacts, ABCs from air pollution may weaken the monsoon rainfall in parts of South and East Asia, thus presenting conflicting options between those regions that are negatively impacted by global warming and those by air pollution. Another potentially major negative impact of ABCs is that the solar heating of the atmosphere by soot can accelerate the atmospheric warming by greenhouse gases and thus contributes significantly to the observed retreat of the Himalayan glaciers. The uncertainties in our understanding of these effects are large, but the deeper we delve into the science we are discovering new ways in which human activities are changing the environment during the Anthropocene (the time period of humanity), and the ethical and scientific dilemmas are becoming more formidable. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Soil erosion modelling can be one of the tools that can assist to gain a better understanding of soil degradation processes. In this study, the physically based LISEM model was applied to a forested catchment in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas to simulate discharge and soil loss. Input data needed for the model were collected in the catchment. The model was calibrated using saturated conductivity and Manning's n as calibration parameters. After calibration, the model was applied to simulate the effects of land use change. The results showed that, after calibration of the model, some events could be simulated reasonably well, but other events could not be properly simulated. The reasons for this are likely to be uncertainty regarding the input data, and the fact that LISEM does not include all processes that are occurring in the catchment. In particular, throughflow is not simulated by LISEM at all, and interception is likely to be underestimated. Calibration also showed a clear relationship between rainfall intensity and calibration settings for saturated conductivity. Such a relationship increases the confidence we can have in predicted runoff for events for which only rainfall data were available. Scenario simulations indicated that both degradation of existing forests, and urbanisation are likely to increase runoff volumes and erosion amounts, but urbanisation was simulated to have much larger effect than forest degradation.

This study addresses the influence of Bronssonetia papyrifera on the native scrub forest at the Himalayan Foothills, Islamabad, Pakistan and its relationship with ecological gradients which are important in terms of its spatial distribution. Floristic species composition and environmental factors were measured from 77 plots from two sites of the scrub forest at the lower elevation of Margalla Hills National Park Islamabad. Agglomerative hierarchical Cluster Analysis (CA) was used for species assemblage patterns and ordination analyses such as Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to establish the relationship with the underlying ecological gradients. CA divided the plots into three vegetation zones: a vegetation zone comprised of species of native scrub forest dominated by Acacia modesta; a transition vegetation zone where B. papyrifera was present either in scattered form amongst the scrub forest species or showed patchy distribution and invasive vegetation zone dominated by B. papyrifera. Man Whitney U-test was used to find out if vegetation zones identified by CA could be significantly different from each other based on the measured environmental factors. Factor Analysis (FA)/Principal Components Analysis (PCA) were used to identify set of environmental factors/predictors, which can best discriminate vegetation zones. FA/PCA (raw varimax rotated) on the environmental factors renders three varifactors with eigenvalues higher than 1.0 accounting for over 72% of total variance. Multivariate analyses indicated that the spatial distribution of B. papyrifera is related to edaphic factors such as the soil texture. organic matter and moisture contents. The distribution was insensitive to the topographic factors. The probable consequences of B. papyrifera invasion for future scrub forest composition and plant species diversity are also discussed.

Location: The 'region' of tropical and sub-tropical South and Southeast Asia stretches from the Himalayas and the southern border of China in the north, to Sri Lanka and Indonesia in the south, and from Pakistan in the west to the islands of New Guinea in the far east. Methods: The regional land-cover map is based on sub-regional digital mapping results derived from SPOT-VEGETATION satellite data for the years 1998-2000. Image processing, digital classification and thematic mapping were performed separately for the three sub-regions of South Asia, continental Southeast Asia, and insular Southeast Asia. Landsat TM images, field data and existing national maps served as references. We used the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) for coding the sub-regional land-cover classes and for aggregating the latter to a uniform regional legend. A validation was performed based on a systematic grid of sample points, referring to visual interpretation from high-resolution Landsat imagery. Regional land-cover area estimates were obtained and compared with FAO statistics for the categories 'forest' and 'cropland'. Results: The regional map displays 26 land-cover classes. The LCCS coding provided a standardized class description, independent from local class names; it also allowed us to maintain the link to the detailed sub-regional land-cover classes. The validation of the map displayed a mapping accuracy of 72% for the dominant classes of 'forest' and 'cropland'; regional area estimates for these classes correspond reasonably well to existing regional statistics. Main conclusions: The land-cover map of South and Southeast Asia provides a synoptic view of the distribution of land cover of tropical and sub-tropical Asia, and it delivers reasonable thematic detail and quantitative estimates of the main land-cover proportions. The map may therefore serve for regional stratification or modelling of vegetation cover, but could also support the implementation of forest policies, watershed management or conservation strategies at regional scales. 2007 European Commission-DG Joint Research Centre.",NA,"English","digital mapping;  image processing;  land cover;  Landsat thematic mapper;  satellite data;  vegetation classification;  vegetation mapping, Asia;  Eurasia;  South Asia;  Southeast Asia","03050270","10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01637.x","4",NA,NA,NA,"625-637","a Land-Cover Map for South and Southeast Asia Derived from Spot-Vegetation Data.","selected",NA,"excluded"

The 13C of cement from Mohand Rao section varies from - 10.5 to - 0.2 with progressive increase in values from 9 to 7.3 Ma indicating gradual change of existing C3 type vegetation to C 4 type vegetation. Post 7.3 Ma, the 13C value is anchored around zero per mil indicating mixed C3-C4 environment with C4 dominating the ecosystem. In Haripur Khol section, the 13C value of EDCC from sandstone indicates presence of both C3 and C4 type of plants with dominance of C4 in the ecosystem, which corroborates the results of our previous study based on carbon isotope ratio of soil carbonates. The oxygen isotope ratio of EDCC from sandstones does not show any systematic variation with time. The 18O values of EDCC from Mohand Rao section ranges from - 8.9 to - 13.6 and in Haripur Khol section, from - 9.9 to - 13.6. At a given stratigraphic level, the average 18O value of EDCC of sandstones is lower (up to 4) compared to the average 18O of soil carbonate from the same or adjacent level (using our earlier published data from Haripur Khol section). The depletion in 18O of EDCC may be due to contribution of contemporary river water infiltrating the groundwater system in the post-monsoon period. Carbon and oxygen isotope ratio of soil carbonate nodules and carbon isotope ratio of associated organic matter from the same nodules were also measured from the Mohand Rao section in a few cases (n = 9). From 9 to 8 Ma, the carbon isotope ratio of soil carbonates varies from - 10.8 to - 7.8 indicating dominance of C3 type vegetation in the flood plain. In contrast, from 5.4 to 4.8 Ma, the 13C ranges from 0.1 to - 4.3 indicating that the vegetation consisted of mixed C3-C4 plants with C4 dominating the ecosystem.

The study focuses on the impact of land-use types on soil quality by measuring the differences in chemical and physical properties at three sites in adjacently located natural forest land (forest), fallow grassland (grass) and arable land (arable). Soil samples from 0-15 and 15-30 cm depth were collected and examined for particle distribution, dry bulk density, organic matter (OM), pH, macro- and micronutrients. Land-use types had a significant effect on primary soil particle distribution. Highest clay content was found in forest and highest sand content in arable. Forest had relatively the highest levels of OM, macro- and micro-nutrients and arable the lowest. Most of the properties of the 0-15 cm surface level of grass were similar to those observed in the 15-30 cm level in forest. Arable exhibited lowest nutrient status and poorest physical conditions, indicating a degrading effect of arable cultivation practices on soil. Grass and arable showed, compared to forest, a 30-60% average increase in bulk density and 26-66% average decrease in OM. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation of OM with available phosphorus and potassium while it had negative correlation with dry bulk density and pH. Natural vegetation appeared to be a main contributor of soil quality as it maintained the organic carbon stock, and increased the nutrient status of soil and is therefore important for sustainable development of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and other similar areas. Furthermore, OM was shown to be an important indicator of soil quality. 2005 Taylor & Francis.",NA,"English",NA,"09064710","10.1080/09064710510008720","3",NA,NA,NA,"221-228","Effects of Different Land-Use Types on Soil Quality in the Hilly Area of Rawalakot Azad Jammu and Kashmir.","unknown",NA,"selected"

Most new Indian generating capacity over the past 20 years has been provided by thermal plants but the tide could now finally be turning in favour of hydroelectricity. Nathpa Jhakri has been developed by Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN), which was previously known as the Nathpa Jhakri Power Corporation (NJPC). The company was set up by the Himachal Pradesh state government and the federal government: the latter provided most of the funding with some help from the World Bank. The project's site on the River Satluj in the Kinnaur and Shimla districts of Himachal Pradesh, in the foothills of the Himalayas, has long been considered ideal for a hydroelectric development and the original plan to build the plant was drawn up in the 1970s. Construction work did not begin until 1992 and was expected to be completed by 1998 but a major rock fall prompted a redesign of the scheme. Strike action and repeated major flood damage to the 60m dam provided further problems and even as late as August 2000, the World Bank talked of problems with the project at its review meeting. However, the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) was co-opted to the project and work was brought back on schedule after it took over the then NJPC. Nathpa Jhakri's six 255MW units were brought on stream between October 2003 and March 2004, and all remain fully operational. The project is notable on a global scale for several reasons: the power tunnel is one of the world's longest at 28km, while the scheme also boasts the world's largest underground desilting complex and the deepest surge shaft.",NA,"English","Construction;  Dams;  Water power, Dam construction, Hydrodynamics, construction;  electricity generation;  hydroelectric power plant, construction;  electricity generation;  hydroelectric power plant, Asia;  Eastern Hemisphere;  Eurasia;  Himachal Pradesh;  India;  South Asia;  World","0306400X",NA,"10",NA,NA,NA,"28-29","a Boost for Hydro.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

We tested the humped-back prediction in the arid Trans-Himalayan mountain grassland with a seasonal grazing system. The study area is located in the bottom of a U-shaped valley, in the Manang district (3500 m a.s.l.). We sampled two hundred plots (1m 1m) in two different types of pastures: common pasture and old field, which both have similar grazing practices. There was a significant unimodal relationship between species richness and biomass only in the common pasture, and when the two sites were analyzed together. The species turnover is estimated by DCA in standard deviation unit. The turnover was lower in the old field than in the common pasture. The unimodal relationship between plant species richness and biomass did not disappear after accounting for unknown environmental gradients expressed as DCA (detrended correspondence analysis) axes and spatial variables.

These assemblages derive from at least four horizons of the Tatrot and Pinjor Formations (spanning the period between 4 and 1.8 Ma). Among the microvertebrates, a diverse assemblage of micromammals, including rodents, insectivores and lagomorphs, has been recovered from these deposits. These accumulations have been found to be primarily of scatological origin. The most common microfossil communities belonged to pond, pond bank, wooded grassland, sandy plain, bushland and temperate montane habitats. Presence of gerbil rodents such as Tatera associated with lizards (e.g. Uromastyx, Calotes and scincid) in some deposits might indicate semi-arid conditions or intermittent dry periods. The replacement of survival-oriented cricetids by reproduction-oriented murid rodents in the Late Miocene is indicative of inter-annual seasonal variations (intensification of monsoons). Across the Mio-Pliocene boundary a change in the dietary habits among the murid rodents has also been observed. The Mid-Miocene non-grazers such as Antemus and Progonomys gave way to Late Miocene (Parapelomys and Karnimata) and Pliocene forms (Dilatomys, Bandicota, Nesokia, Hadromys, and Golunda), which were predominantly grazers. An increase in body size among the Pliocene murid rodents has been inferred from the size of their first upper molars. Within the Pliocene, across the Tatrot-Pinjor boundary (around 2.5 Ma), among the rodents a significant change at the generic level, leading to the appearance of modern forms such as Hadromys, Bandicota, Nesokia, Rhizomys, and Tatera, has been observed. This period (2.5 Ma) is marked also by a great diversification of murid species, probably indicating an intensification of monsoons. This interpretation is further strengthened by the occurrence of a diverse palynological assemblage reflecting alternately wet and dry conditions. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Cross-taxon congruence in biodiversity (-diversity and -diversity) across macrolichens, mosses, liverworts, woody plants (shrubs and trees) and ants was investigated, so as to examine the extent to which these groups of organisms can function as surrogates for each other. Although woody plants provided a major substrate for macrolichens and mosses, there was no species-specific association between them. Woody plant species richness was highly positively correlated with mosses (r2 = 0.63, P &lt; 0.001), but the relationship was not particularly very strong with lichens and liverworts. While there was a significant correlation in the species turnover (-diversity) of macrolichens with mosses (r2 = 0.21, P &lt; 0.005), the relationship was relatively poor with the woody plants. On the other hand, negative correlations emerged in the species richness of ants with those of macrolichens, mosses and woody plants (r2 = -0.44, P &lt; 0.05), but most of the complementarity (turnover) relationships among them were positive. Since diversity between taxonomic hierarchies within the group was consistently significantly positively correlated in all these taxa, the higher taxonomic categories such as genus and family may be employed as surrogates for rapid assessment and monitoring of species diversity. Although no single group other than macrolichens has emerged as a good indicator of changes in species richness in all other groups, some concordant relationships between them conform to the hypothesis that species assemblages of certain taxonomic groups could still be used as surrogates for efficient monitoring of species diversity in other groups whose distribution may further predict the importance of conserving overall biodiversity in landscapes such as the Garhwal Himalaya. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Our results show that during the late Middle Miocene to early Late Miocene (~11.5- ~8 Ma, Lower Siwalik) the Himalayan foothills and the Gangetic floodplain of Nepal were mainly forested with subtropical to temperate broad-leafed (b.l.) taxa (e.g. Quercus, Lithocarpus/Castanopsis, Alnus), and tropical forest taxa respectively. Grasses were present at the time but were not abundant. Between the early to late Late Miocene (~8-~6.5 Ma; lower Middle Siwalik) grassland replaced subtropical and temperate b.l. forest. This change may be related to disturbance of the vegetation on the slopes due to uplift, perhaps enhanced by intensification of the monsoon. Between late Late Miocene to Pliocene/Early Pleistocene? (~6.5&lt; 2 Ma; Middle-Upper Siwalik) the grassland vegetation became well established and the influence of the subtropical climax vegetation is minor, with some occasional revivals. An increase in peak discharge in the fluvial system (also related to monsoonal intensification?) is recognized by an increase of the aquatic taxon Potamogeton and better preservation of all specimens. Enhanced seasonal flooding in the system during the Pliocene (~5.5-~3.5 Ma; top Middle Siwalik) may have produced local lacustrine conditions on the overbanks, evidenced by an abundance of algae (Spirogyra) and pteridophytes in the pollen assemblages. Evidence of climatic cooling between ~6.5-~5 Ma ago is indicated by the onset of steppe taxa, decrease of tropical forest taxa and disappearance of certain Dipterocarpaceae. Pollen assemblages from the Surai Khola section suggest complex vegetation changes, of which the shift to C4 grass dominance was only one. Global climatic cooling, the intensification of the monsoon, and the Late Miocene uplift may all have contributed to the phytogeography in the Sub-Himalayan Zone.

This topic was mostly treated from a climatological point of view. Only recently, integrated approaches are pursued using the indicator functions of the vegetation for monsoonal humidity influx in more detail. In this paper, new climatological findings are correlated with recent vegetation ecological and phytogeographical studies in order to assess the dependence of closed sub-humid forests on monsoonal precipitation north of the main Himalayan range. General climatic conditions in the region are characterized by a SW-NE-directed gradient of decreasing humidity. They result from the position in a transitional area of two genetically different precipitation regimes: Extratropical westerly circulation and tropical monsoon regime. This paper analyzes the relationships of monsoonal humidity influx and distribution patterns, synecology, synsociology, and regeneration of major forest communities (Pinus wallichiana-, Picea smithiana-communities) towards the dry limits of forests in the region. Small-scale distribution patterns of forest stands correspond to the spatial differentiation of water vapour transport from shallow monsoonal depressions over the crestlines of West Himalaya and Karakorum. This transport is modified by the topography of high mountain chains, acting as barriers against moist labile air masses from the south. The gradual decrease of humidity along the SW-NE-gradient is reflected by synsociological characteristics of communities, i.e. by their differentiations into mesic and xeric subassociations. The forests appear to be relict ecosystems of moister periods of the Holocene. Under presently drier conditions in an extreme subtropical arid high mountain environment, the maintenance of an equable forest climate is indispensable for successful regeneration. Thus, further forest degradation will lead to an irreversible loss of forest habitats.","Gebruder Borntraeger Verlagsbuchhandlung","English","climate;  forest ecosystem;  monsoon;  plant community;  regeneration;  spatial distribution, Himalayas;  Karakorum;  Pakistan, Picea smithiana;  Pinus wallichiana","0340269X","10.1127/phyto/30/2000/633","3-4",NA,NA,NA,"633-654","The Impact of Asian Summer Monsoon on Forest Distribution Patterns, Ecology, and Regeneration North of the Main Himalayan Range (e-Hindukush, Karakorum)","unknown",NA,"excluded"

A meridional transect crosses parts of High Asia between 43 and 34N, including the Turgen Valley in the Sailijskij Alatan (Northern Tian Shan), Kuilju Valley in the Kuiljutau (Arpatakyr Plateau between Southern and Central Tian Shan), Oytagh Valley at Kara-Bahtiyar (Western Kunlun), Chaprot Valley in the Western Karakoram and Kaghan Valley located at the southern slopes of North-Western Himalaya. This sequence corresponds with the continental-oceanic change with summer precipitation in the north and central areas and winter and summer precipitation in the south. A brief summary of the results of this investigation follows: The comparison of differences in exposure and altitudinal belts in the study area improves knowledge mainly in the less known Oytagh, Arpatakyr and Sailijskij Alatau. No major floristic relationship between the different mountain ranges was found. There is a distinct border between Karakoram and Western Kunlun that differentiates the Tibet-Himalaya complex from the Tian Shan complex. A distinct transmission of maximum exposure contrasts is present in all five mountain ranges. It shows the semi-arid transition, found in the medium altitudes of the 'dry' mountains and in the lower altitudes of the 'moist' mountains. The application of the similarity analysis is a new approach of plant geography to enable climatological interpretation in semi-arid to semi-humid mountains. The climatic-ecological view leads to estimations concerning the genesis of regional air streams and of humidity patterns. The latter can be used to explain the lack or presence of certain altitudinal belts, e.g. of dark forests in the western Kunlun. The Karakoram and parts of the Western Kunlun, the mountains with the driest foothills, are defined by a high precipitation gradient. The equalization of humidity in the high belts leads to a floristic similarity between the alpine belts of all mountain ranges. The altitudinal differentiation indicates a distinct change of humidity from the arid centre with its elevated position of vegetation-belts, as well as of solifluidal forms to the more humid borders with its depression of corresponding belts. However, some mountain areas in the arid centre show remarkable small-scaled differences in precipitation.","Ferd.

Moreover, the boundaries in Ladakh, Shyok and Tibetan areas preserve thin ophiolites, blueschists as well as highly deformed flysch sediments. The accretionary diagrams to the terrane map has been subdivided into the following minor and major terranes from the south to north: (1) Indian Subcontinental Shield; (2) Salt Range; (3) Molasse Zone of Siwalik Foothills; (4) Lesser or Southern Himalayan Belt; (5) Higher or Great Himalaya including Tethyan Zone; (6) Trans-Himalaya including Indus-Tsangpo Suture Zone of Ladakh; and (7) Karakoram Range. The subduction zone is marked by ophiolitic melanges between the Lamayuru Flysch and the Dras-Nindam Unit, which was formed in the fore- arc basin and southern slope of an island arc. The Ladakh-Gangdese plutonic complex represents a magmatic arc and the sequence of the Shyok lineament seems to have been deposited in a back arc basin. All these terranes north of the subduction zone are formed on the Eurasian plate. The Lhasa Block - a Gondwana fragment accreted to the Eurasian Plate already in the Cretaceous. The Indus Molasse was deposited after the collision along the suture zone transgressing on the Dras Unit and the Ladakh-Gangdese Pluton, North of the Shyok Zone the metamorphic, sedimentary and plutonic belts of the Karakoram Terrane follow. Some units could be recognized as suspected terranes on the basis of different stratigraphic history and magmatic criteria. The latest dated rock by Sm-Nd methods is 25100.09 Ma (Bhat and LeFort, 1992) representing the Rampur volcanics in Satluj valley. The collision occurred approximately during 56-60 Ma (Beck et al., 1995). The sedimentary-tectonic evolution of the Himalaya is characterized by thick basin deposits indicating a continental margin at the base of the Lesser as well as High Himalayan sequences. In the High Himalaya, a Precambrian-Early Palaeozoic age of these trough deposits is documented. After an orogenic event in the Cambrian- Silurian overstep sequences of epicontinental origin follow, exhibiting major facies variation along the Himalayan strike. The eruption of Upper Carboniferous-Permian Panjal Volcanics and a gap in sedimentation is the signal of the rifting and the opening of the Tethys. After the quiet shelf sedimentation in the Mesozoic, a facies differentiation is reflected in miogeocline which is followed by the Mid-Cretaceous-Eocene subduction. During the Maastrichtian the first contact of the edge of India with the island arc is indicated followed by a collision during Lower Eocene. After the collision, molasse basins existed along the suture zone and along the front of the Himalayan orogen. Finally, they also were folded and overthrusted. This work is a first attempt to produce the conceptual terrane model map from the Himalayan region. Yet many puzzles are to be solved to understand the migration and accretion of terranes. In some restricted and inaccessible areas almost no geological information is available. Hence, a final picture with more comprehensive data, would emerge later.","A.A.

The total plantation biomass increased from 840 in the 5-year-old to 1700 t ha-1 in the 8-year-old plantation and NPP from 168 t ha-1 year-1 in the 5- and 6-year-old to 218 t ha-1 year-1 in the 8-year-old plantation. The biomass accumulation ratio (biomass: net production, BAR) for different tree components increased with the age of plantation increase.

The possible interaction between the exotic species and the already existing naturalised species or natives needs to be quantified before the establishment of massive plantations takes place. This set of mixture trials involved evaluation of intra- and interspecific competition between and within fast growing Leucaena leucocephala (exotic) with the relatively slow growing Acacia nilotica (indigenous). An even aged mixed plantation in a hexagonal arrangement with varying proportions of the two species around an indicator or test tree was raised. Periodical observations revealed the quantitative changes in tree growth brought about by the serial manipulation of the neighbours of the indicator tree. In all the combinations, Leucaena exhibited profuse height growth, steady diameter increase, dense canopy and a high wood volume. Acacia, with a slow height growth, lesser diameter increase and bushy habit, exhibited suppressed growth, this effect increasing in combinations with an increased number of Leucaena. Such an intensively competitive combination of a fast growing exotic with a slow growing native would enhance the biomass production potential of the area but may eventually result in the elimination of the native trees. This warrants immediate attention, thoughtful selection and careful planning of exotics for large-scale introduction in afforestation programmes. 1993.",NA,"English","acacia;  forestry plantation;  leucaena;  multipurpose tree;  plantation forestry;  tree competition;  yield, India;  India, Shivaliks, Acacia nilotica;  Leucaena leucocephala","03781127","10.1016/0378-1127(93)90174-L","1-4",NA,NA,NA,"213-231","Competition in the Early Establishment Phases of an Even Aged Mixed Plantation of Leucaena Leucocephala and Acacia Nilotica.","selected",NA,"selected"

Among saline wetlands, mangroves which are coastal and estuarine forested wetlands, are among the world's largest such formations.

Frequent cyclones and reduced freshwater flows due to river regulation are important factors causing degradation of these wetlands.

The Himalayan mountains are the youngest, and among the most unstable. The rainfall pattern is determined by the summer monsoon which deposits a considerable amount of rain (often above 2500 mm annually) on the outer ranges. The amount of annual rainfall decreases from east to west, but the contribution of the winter season to the total precipitation increases. Mountains of these dimensions separate the monsoon climate of south Asia from the cold and dry climate of central Asia. In general, a rise of 270 m in elevation corresponds to a fall of 1C in the mean annual temperature up to 1500 m, above which the fall is relatively rapid. Large scale surface removals and cyclic climatic changes influenced the course of vegetational changes through geological time. The Himalayan ranges, which started developing in the beginning of the Cenozoic, earlier supported tropical wet evergreen forests throughout the entire area (presently confined to the eastern part). The Miocene orogeny caused drastic changes in the vegetation, so much so that the existing flora was almost entirely replaced by the modern flora. Almost all the dominant forest species of the Pleistocene continue to maintain their dominant status to the present. Presently the Himalayan ranges encompass Austro-Polynesian, Malayo-Burman, Sino-Tibetan, Euro-Mediterranean, and African elements. While the Euro-Mediterranean affinities are well represented in the western Himalayan region (west of 77E long.), the Chinese and Malesian affinities are evident in the eastern region (east of 84E long.). However, the proportion of endemic taxa is substantial in the entire region. A representation of formation types in relation to climatic factors, viz., rainfall and temperature, indicates that boundaries between the types are not sharp. Formation types often integrate continuously, showing broad overlaps. Climate does not entirely determine the formation type, and the influence of soil, fire, etc., is also substantial. The ombrophilous broad leaf forests located in the submontane belt (&lt; 1000 m) of the eastern region are comparable to the typical tropical rain forests. On the other extreme, communities above 3000 m elevation are similar to sub-alpine and alpine types. From favorable to less favorable environments, as observed with decreasing moisture from east to west, or with decreasing temperature from low to high elevations, the forests become increasingly open, shortstatured and simpler, with little vertical stratification. Ordination of forest stands distributed within 300-2500 m elevations of the central Himalaya, by and large indicates a continuity of communities, with scattered centers of species importance values in the ordination field. Within the above elevational transect, sal (Shorea robusta) and oak (Quercus spp.) forests may be designated as the climax communities, respectively, of warmer and cooler climates. The flora of a part of the central Himalayan region is categorized as therohemigeophytic and that of a part of the western Himalayan region as geochamaephytic. An analysis of population structure over large areas in the central Himalaya, based on density-diameter distribution of trees, suggests that oldgrowth forests are being replaced by even-aged successional forests, dominated by a few species, such as Pinus roxburghii. Paucity of seedlings of climax species, namely Shorea robusta and Quercus spp. over large areas is evident. The Himalayan catchments are subsurface-flow systems and, therefore, are particularly susceptible to landslips and landslides. Loss of water and soil in terms of overflow is insignificant. Studies on recovery processes of forest ecosystems damaged due to shifting cultivation or landslides indicate that the ecosystems can recover quite rapidly, at least in elevations below 2500 m. For example, on a damaged forest site, seedlings of climax species (Quercus leucotrichophora) appeared only 21 years after the landslide. In the central Himalaya, the biomass of a majority of forests (163-787 t ha-1) falls within the range (200-600 t ha-1) given for many mature forests of the world, and the net primary productivity (found in the range of 11.0-27.4 t ha-1 yr-1) is comparable with the range of 20-30 t ha-1 yr-1 given for highly productive communities of favorable environments. In most of the forests of this region, the litter fall values (2.1-3.8 t C ha-1 yr-1) are higher than the mean reported for warm temperate forests (2.7 t C ha-1 yr-1). Of the total litter, the tree leaves account for 54-82% in the Himalayan forests. The rate of decomposition of leaves in some broadleaf species of submontane belt (0.253-0.274% day-1) are comparable with those reported for some tropical rain forest species. Because of the paucity of microorganisms and microarthropods in the forest litter and soil, high initial C:N ratio and high initial lignin content in leaves, the rate of leaf litter decomposition in Pinus roxburghii is markedly slower than in other species of the central Himalaya. The fungal species composition of the leaf litter of Pinus roxburghii is also distinct from those of other species. A greater proportion of nutrients is accumulated in the biomass component of the Himalayan forests than in the temperate forests. Although litter fall is the major route through which nutrients return from biomass to the soil pool, a substantial proportion of the total return is in the form of throughfall and stemflow. Among the dominant species of the central Himalaya, retranslocation of nutrients from the senescing leaves was markedly greater in Pinus roxburghii than in Quercus spp. and Shorea robusta. Consequently, the C:N ratio of leaf litter is markedly higher in Pinus roxburghii than in the other species. Immobilization of nutrients by the decomposers of the litter with high C:N ratio is one of the principal strategies through which Pinus roxburghii invades other forests and holds the site against possible reinvasion by oaks. Observations on the seasonality of various ecosystem functions suggest that Himalayan ecosystems are geared to take maximum advantages of the monsoon period (rainy season). Most of the human population depends on shifting-agriculture in the eastern region and on settled agriculture in the central and western regions. Either of these is essentially a forest-dependent cultivation. Each unit of agronomic energy produced in the settled agriculture entails about seven units of energy from forests. Consequently, forests with reasonable crown cover account for insignificant percentage of the land. Tea plantations and felling of trees for timber, paper pulp, etc., are some of the major commercial activities which adversely affected the Himalayan forests. 1987 The New York Botanical Garden.",NA,"English",NA,"00068101","10.1007/BF02858183","1",NA,NA,NA,"192-80","Forest Vegetation of the Himalaya.","selected",NA,"selected"

In this study, rainfall distribution during the break monsoon situations has been studied, over the southern slopes of the Sikkim, Nepal and Uttar Pradesh Himalayas (i.e. from longitude 78E to 89E) and their adjoining plains. Rainfall distributions during the major break situations which occurred during the principal monsoon months of July and August of the period from 1957 to 1969 were studied. This study has shown that, on a break day, positive percentage departures of rainfall as high as 100 to 300 per cent have occurred at stations located in the outer Himalayas and the adjoining plains of north Bengal, east and central Nepal, Bihar and east Uttar Pradesh. However, the width of this heavy rainbelt is maximum over the hills and plains of southeastern Nepal and the adjoining plains of north Bihar. This study has also shown that on a break day there is a decrease of rainfall activity over the Himalayas west of longitude 80E. Decrease of rainfall also takes place along a narrow belt immediately to the south of the great Himalayan range to the east of longitude 80cE outside Sikkim. Over the adjoining Gangetic plains, an increase in rainfall is noticed even to the south of the Ganga river in Bihar and its neighbourhood. Thus, owing to the increase in rainfall activity during break monsoon situations in the catchments of Himalayan rivers located in Sikkim and Nepal, a peculiar situation arises which is responsible for causing floods in the downstream plains which experience almost drought conditions.

A new Bouguer anomaly map of India and its generalized interpretation is presented in this paper. Bouguer anomalies in India show good correlation with the geology and tectonics. Isostatic anomalies in India are primarily geologic anomalies caused by intracrustal inhomogeneities. For example, the negative isostatic anomalies in southern India arise from large thicknesses of granitic bodies in the upper crust and the positive anomaly over the Himalaya may be attributed to a possible thickening of the basalt layer in the lower crust. The gravity data suggest that an overall isostatic equilibrium generally prevails in India and the Himalayan region. Crustal thickness estimates from DSS data in India are comparable to the values obtained from gravity data based on the Ahy's concept of isostatic compensation. Copyright 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

About 31 numbers ranging from 40 to 128 are so far known to occur in Saccharum spontaneum, of which about nine occur with markedly higher frequencies than the rest. Groups with chromosome numbers which are multiples of eight seem to have a higher survival value than those with others. The distribution area is divisible into three Sectors: the Western with a chromosome number range of 112-128, the Eastern with a range of 80-112, and Central with 40-80. The Central Sector appears to have had a higher evolutionary activity in the species than the other two sectors. The lowest numbers 40 and 48 occur in India, in the Gangetic valley sub-montane to the Central Himalayas, and also in the four south-eastern deltaic areas, Since the area encompassing the locations of low chromosome number groups has also the largest concentration of chromosome numbers, it is of cytogeographic interest. The 54-chromosome group is believed to extend along various river basins from the Aral Sea to the Bay of Bengal. The 64-group is somewhat ubiquitous in India, dominant in the peninsula; Central India has mostly 62 to 72-chromosome clones to the exclusion of other numbers. The 80-chromosome forms occur restrictedly in Nepal, Assam and the Western Ghats. The number 112 occurs both in the Western and Eastern Sectors, but the two groups are probably distinct. 80 and 96 are conspicuously absent from the area between India and Africa. The forms of the Western Sector have many distinctive characters in common. They are probably of autopolyploid origin. In the Eastern Sector, the typical numbers are 80, 96 and 112. In most of the areas, 80 and/or 96 occur to the exclusion of other major numbers, whereas Java, Sumatra and Borneo have almost exclusively 112-chromosome forms. The 80-chromosome forms form a continuous chain from Nepal to Fiji, by-passing the major part of Indonesia. 64-chromosomes occur exceptionally in Burma, Malay and Mauritius. These are believed to be accidental introductions from India. By analogy, the presence of the 112-chromosome forms in the China-Japan area may be attributed to Chinese trade activity with Indonesia. 1960, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

Nine fossil species of the Salicace are described from leaf impressions among the material collected partly by R. R. Stewart in 1936 and partly by the author in 1940 from a few spots from the Ningal Nullah locality lying near Botapathri at an elevation of 9,000 ft. above sea-level; the strata are exposed on a wide grassy meadow on the right bank of Ningal Nullah stream. The fossiliferous beds belong to the Lower Karewa Series and are Pleistocene in Age. 2. Of the nine species described in this paper there are four, namely, Salix Wallichiana, S. denticulata, Populus ciliata and P. nigra var. fastigiaia which are fully determined, the remaining five incompletely determined species include three belonging to Salix, which could not be identified specifically on account of the fragmentary nature of the plant material; and two distinct species of Populus, that do not seem to resemble any modern Himalayan species. 3. All the fully determined species are represented in the modern flora of the Kashmir Valley, and Salix Wallichiana occurs at the present time in temperate parts of the Himalayas from Kurram Valley (alt. 10-12,000 ft.) through Kashmir to as far east as Garhwal (alt. 12,500 ft.), Nepal and Bhutan. It also occurs in moist places in the inner dry valleys of Pangi and Kagan. Salix denticulata is commonly found in the north-western Himalayas extending eastwards also like the first species, from the Kurram Valley to Western Nepal. Populus ciliata, the common Himalayan poplar, also grows in temperate regions between the altitudes of 4,000 and 10,000 ft., from the Kagan Valley through Kashmir to Bhutan. Populus nigra, var. fastigiata which is wild in Kabul is believed to be cultivated at the present time in the Western Himalayas up to the altitude of 12,500 ft. 4. A comparison of the past and present distribution of the well determined fossil species, which are still growing in the Kashmir Valley near the fossiliferous region at the present time indicates that this part of the valley, at least, at one time during the Pleistocene had probably enjoyed a temperate climate essentially similar to modern climate of the valley, and this would have allowed the growth of temperate species like Juglons regia, Rhamnus purpurea, Prunus cornuta, Pyrus Malus, Acer Csium, etc., all of which are the present as well as the past associates of the Salicace. 5. Though the terrestrial element of this flora as a whole does not indicate in clear terms that the uplift of the fossiliferous beds had taken place after their deposition, the presence among them of an aquatic element represented by a leaf fragment of Nelumbo nucifera, and some parallel-veined leaf fragments comparable to modern species of Sparganium and Typha, shows beyond doubt that the beds had been uplifted by the Pleistocene Himalayan Orogenies. 6. While discussing the significance of temperate species in this flora it is pointed out that the other two floras discovered at Laredura and Liddarmarg indicate a prevalence in the valley, during the Pleistocene, of tropical or sub-tropical climate opposed to a cooler climate indicated by the Ningal Nullah species. 7. The causes of the occurrence during the Pleistocene of three different floras on the northern slopes of the Pir Panjal Range of that time contemporaneously at three localities are also hinted at but a fuller discussion of this question is reserved for a later occasion. 1945 Indian Academy of Sciences.",NA,"English",NA,"03700097","10.1007/BF03048769","3",NA,NA,NA,"112-87","some Fossil Leaves of the Salicace"" from Ningal Nullah and Laredura, Pir Panjal, with a Note on the Significance of Temperate Species in the Pleistocene Flora of Kashmir.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

Empirical relationships were established between satellite data-derived spectral indices, band reflectance and ground measured foliar N and C using machine learning algorithm (MLA). Performance of MLAs viz. Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were assessed. Using all the independent spectral variables, RF performed better than ANN and SVM in explaining the variation in foliar N and C. RF was further used to optimize the independent variables for identifying the best predictor variables. It was found that foliar N is strongly related to shortwave infrared-1 (SWIR-1) band and Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE). Foliar C was found to be strongly related to SWIR-1 band and spectral vegetation indices: Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Green Red Vegetation Index (GRVI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI), and Ratio of Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index and Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MCARI/OSAVI). Using these best predictor variables, the spatial variability of foliar N and C was mapped using RF algorithm. On validation of the predicted N and C with ground measured foliar N and C, R (2) of 0.85 (RMSE = 0.04\%) for N and R (2) of 0.86 (RMSE = 0.26\%) for C were observed.

However, little is known on whether these patterns mediate responses to climate in marginal tree populations such as those forming alpine tree lines. We examined the influence of tree-to-tree interactions on the responsiveness of tree lines to climate warming. Location Central Himalayas. Taxon Betula utilis; Abies spectabilis. Methods We analysed a network of 17 tree line sites located across the central Himalayas, encompassing a wide longitudinal gradient characterized by increasing precipitation eastwards. We quantified the changes in density and the spatial patterns of three 50-year age classes of the two main tree species found at the tree line (Betula utilis and Abies spectabilis), and related them to reconstructed shifts in tree line elevation. Results Younger trees showed clustering near the tree line, while older trees tended to show random spatial distribution. Clustering decreased as climate conditions ameliorated, that is, in the wetter eastern sites. Lower rate of tree line elevation change was observed at the sites with higher clustering intensity. Main Conclusions Our study indicates that tree aggregation weakens tree line responsiveness to climate warming, and thus warming-induced drought stress tends to lower tree line shift rates by enhancing clustering. It also highlights the complexity and contingency of site-dependent tree line responses to climate. Hence, to advance our understanding of tree line processes, we should consider both direct and indirect influences of relevant biotic (tree-to-tree interactions) and abiotic (climate) drivers of tree line dynamics.","WILEY","English","Abies spectabilis; Betula utilis; climate change; clustering; dendroecology; point pattern analysis; recruitment; species interactions; tree density; tree rings","0305-0270","10.1111/jbi.13840 Early Access Date = {{APR 2020","8","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NA,"1816-1826","Tree-to-Tree Interactions Slow Down Himalayan Treeline Shifts as Inferred from Tree Spatial Patterns.","selected",NA,"excluded"

The study was conducted to understand the whole array of variation among five different elevation classes ranging from 400-3000 m asl as well among North and South aspects at the same elevation in Sirmaur district, Himachal Pradesh (Western Himalaya). A total of 30 plots (3 replicates in each forest type) were studied, where each plot represents 10 quadrats of 10 x 10 m size were laid to calculate forest biomass and carbon stocks. The values for Biomass density were in the range of 123.89 +/- 26.33 to 537.77 +/- 56.34 Mg ha(-1) whereas, Carbon density were in the range of 58.23 +/- 14.33 and 252.75 +/- 24.98 Mg ha(-1). The conifer forest types showed an increased amount of carbon density than broad-leaf forest types, but overall broad-leaf species contributed to more carbon stocks in the studied region due to absence of conifer species in lower elevation class. Protection of conifer species, especially Cedrus deodara that were found to contribute maximally to total carbon stocks could be very helpful in carbon sequestration. Also, old-growth individuals for both conifer and broad-leaf should be protected as they have high carbon accumulation potential, therefore, recommended for management in such sites.

We investigated the effects of different types of land cover at different altitudes on SOC stabilization in the Himalayan region, India. We chose four different land covers at different altitudes, viz., pasture land (similar to 2500 m), mixed cover (similar to 2200 m), chirpine (similar to 950 m) and agricultural land (similar to 950 m). Organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N), and total microbial activity (MAt) in soils up to depths of 100 cm and under different types of land cover were assessed to study the impact of vegetation cover on the storage of SOC and N. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) soluble carbon, Fe-DCB/Al-DCB oxides and stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) were determined in the soils under different types of land cover to evaluate the amounts of mineral-associated carbon and understand the organic carbon stabilization process. The maximum SOC stock was observed under a mixed land cover (281.86 t ha(-1)), followed by pasture land cover (229.61 t ha(-1)), chirpine (182.16 t ha(-1)) and agricultural land cover (70.20 t ha(-1)) up to a depth of 100 cm. Higher SOC contents, N contents and MAt were closely linked to the surface layers (0-30 cm), while HF-soluble carbon, Fe-DCB and Al-DCB oxides were linked to sub-surface layers (30-100 cm) of soils under different types of land cover. HF-soluble carbon was more abundant in mixed and pasture land covers compared with chirpine and agricultural land covers. The linear relationship between delta C-13 values and HF-soluble carbon, Fe-DCB/OC, delta C-13, Al-DCB/OC and delta C-13 in soils under mixed and pasture land covers confirmed that the subsurface soil constituted more decomposed carbon and its associated Fe-DCB/Al-DCB minerals. Nevertheless, this trend was not observed in other types of land cover located at lower altitudes and might be due to the root exudates and/or mixing of young and old carbon. These results suggest that the land cover types at higher altitudes in central Himalaya may be considered as a potential sink for the sequestration of atmospheric carbon and as potential sites for the stabilization of sequestered carbon in soils. However, land cover types at lower altitudes in central Himalaya must be managed by better soil management practices to sequester and stabilize more carbon in soils.","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","English","Soil organic carbon; HF-soluble carbon; Fe-DCB/Al-DCB oxides; Inceptisols; Central Himalaya","0341-8162","10.1016/j.catena.2018.06.039",NA,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"374-385","Soil Organic Carbon Stabilization Changes with an Altitude Gradient of Land Cover Types in Central Himalaya, India.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

We sought to determine if recent warming is driving contrasting growth responses of Himalayan birch, at moist treeline (Lete Lekh) and semi-arid timberline (Chimang Lekh) sites in the Trans-Himalayan zone of central Nepal. We used dendrochronological techniques to measure tree ring width (TRW) and basal area increment (BAI) of birch trees from climatically contrasting but nearby sites. The TRW series were correlated with climate records from nearby meteorological stations, and BAI was compared between populations to explore growth trends over recent decades. We found contrasting precipitation trends between nearby sites such that the wet site (Lete) is getting warmer and wetter, and the dry site (Chimang) is getting warmer and drier in recent decades. The radial growth of birch in both moist and semi-arid sites are positively correlated to spring (March-May) rainfall, and negatively correlated to mean and maximum temperature for the same period. The growth climate analysis indicated that moisture availability in early growing season is crucial for birch growth at these locations. The BAI of birch is declining more rapidly at the dry timberline than at the moist treelines in the recent decades, indicating that climatic warming might negatively impact birch radial growth where warming interacts with increasing spring drought in the region. Our work highlights contrasting growth response of birch to climate change at moist and semi-arid forests indicating that local climatic variation must be accounted for when assessing and forecasting regional patterns of tree growth in topographically complex regions like Trans-Himalaya, in order to make accurate predictions of vegetation responses to climate change.","SPRINGER","English","Betula utilis; Treeline; Timberline; Ring width; Basal area increment; Growth trends","1385-0237","10.1007/s11258-017-0716-z","5","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"621-633","Warming Induced Growth Decline of Himalayan Birch at Its Lower Range Edge in a Semi-Arid Region of Trans-Himalaya, Central Nepal.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

Well-developed magnetostratigraphic control provides secure dating so that Siwalik fossil horizons may be interpolated into a time scale with resolution to 100,000 years. We describe the geographic setting of the Potwar, give an overview of the temporal distribution of faunas, and discuss changes in paleohabitat and paleoecology with coinciding faunal change, as seen from the Siwalik viewpoint. The long Siwalik biostratigraphy of many successive assemblages with its resolved time scale may be compared directly with other well-dated sequences. Immigrant arrival and timing of faunal change may be traced. The basins of the Iberian Peninsula show somewhat different timing of introduction of hipparionine horses, and faunal turnover in the Siwaliks clearly precedes the Vallesian crisis in Spain. In contrast to the increasingly seasonal precipitation of the late Miocene Potwar, the paleohabitat of coeval North China appears to have been moist and equable, with high diversity faunas. Continued development and comparison of resolved Neogene records allow increasing resolution of the patterns of faunal change on regional to global levels. (C) 2015 Academie des sciences.

This contribution enhances the data bank on the variation in rich floral diversity from northeast India. Here, we present the first palynological report for the region on palaeovegetation and past climate variations as reflected in the Subankhata swamp of Assam. This is an attempt to show the affinity of the vegetation records of this swamp with Indo-Burma flora based on the remarkable similarity in the trend of vegetation changes over a time period of about 27,000 yrs. The studied palynoassemblage reflects six different vegetational and climatic phases (S-I to S-VI) since the Late Pleistocene. The first phase (S-I) comprises compact organic clay with a little silt. During this phase, a vast lowland savanna forest existed in a cool and dry climate regime similar to what was observed during the Ice Age. Later, during the S-II phase, the forest initially continued with little alteration in tree taxa under a relatively less cool and dry climate. Thereafter, the establishment of forest occurred under the influence of moderate monsoons that led to the onset of a warm and humid climate during the S-III phase which mainly comprises organic clay with silt. During the span of the S-IV phase, vegetation consisting of Dipterocarpaceae, Mesua ferrea, Elaeocarpus and Syzygium are found, indicating warm and humid climatic conditions with high rainfall. The clearance of forest by humans has also been noted in this period. Subsequently, during the S-V zone, the beginning of a gradual decline in arboreals suggests an acceleration in forest clearance, possibly due to human activities as the climate turned warm and less humid. Entering the S-VI zone (probably Late Holocene), a drastic decline occurred in major tree elements, implying relatively dry climatic conditions indicating weakened monsoonal activity. The trend in our findings shows a clear affinity of these variations in the region with the whole Indo-Burma range since the Late Pleistocene.","TAYLOR \& FRANCIS INC","English","Subankhata swamp; human activity; Indo-Burma range; palynoassemblage; India; floral affinity","0191-6122","10.1080/01916122.2014.945665","2","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",NA,NA,"220-233","Late Pleistocene Palaeoclimate Based on Vegetation of the Eastern Himalayan Foothills in the Indo-Burma Range, India.","unknown",NA,"excluded"

Limited field data often lead to poor process conceptualisation in hydrological models. Plot-scale runoff experiments are popularly used to characterise the runoff generation processes in hillslopes. In this study a vegetated hillslope plot, which typically represented the dominating soil and land cover class of the undisturbed natural hillslopes of north-east India, was selected to conduct runoff simulation experiments and to monitor rainfall-runoff processes over a long period of time (2005-2011). The empirical relationships representing the infiltration and surface runoff generation characteristics of the plot were evaluated for temporal deviations. Temporal vegetation dynamics of the plot showed significant control over the runoff generation processes. The natural rainfall-runoff response and measured soil moisture profile of the hillslope plot indicated strong threshold driven mechanism of runoff generation. The majority of storm runoff from the hillslope plot occurred through the subsurface route. Surface runoff events were rare and showed very low runoff coefficients. Rainfall depth, duration, maximum intensity, and antecedent soil moisture conditions primarily controlled the hillslope runoff response. The probability of runoff generation under wet antecedent conditions was high. The rainfall excess hydrographs predicted using the experimentally established empirical function for the hillslope plot compared well with the observed hydrographs only under similar wet antecedent soil moisture conditions.

It has three geographically distinct divisions viz., Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, which are immensely rich in their biological and cultural diversity. Medicinal plants are an important element of indigenous medical system of the region. The main goal of the present article is to examine the use of ethnomedicinal plants in three divisions of J\&K and to discuss cross-cultural consensus on the use of medicinal plants in these divisions. The article also discusses the gaps in the current state of knowledge on ethnomedicinal plants of the region and gives recommendations for the future studies. Materials and Methods: Scientific literature on ethnomedicinal field studies conducted in J\&K state of India available in the journals, edited books and other scientific databases viz., CAB international, DOAJ, Google Scholar, PubMed, Science direct, SciFinder, Scopus and Web of Science were searched. Only field based ethnomedicinal surveys from last four decades up to December 2013 reporting first hand information on the medicinal plants used to treat human health related ailments by indigenous communities of J\&K were included in this study. Venn diagram was used to analyze the cross-cultural consensus on the use of ethnomedicinal plants in the three divisions of J\&K. Results: A total of 948 plant taxa (923 angiosperms, 12 gymnosperms and 13 pteridophytes) belonging to 129 families, 509 genera, 937 species and 11 varieties have so far been reported to have a traditional medicinal use by indigenous communities of J\&K. Asteraceae (60 genera, 132 spp.) was the most frequently used family followed by Fabaceae (32 genera, 50 spp.) and Lamiaceae (27 genera, 55 spp.). 514, 415 and 397 medicinal plants were used in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh divisions, respectively. Sixty eight plant taxa were used in all the three divisions, whereas 95 plants were common between Ladakh and Jammu, 127 plants between Ladakh and Kashmir, and 216 plants between Jammu and Kashmir. Maximum numbers of plant taxa were used for treating dermatological problems (321), followed by cold, cough and throat related ailments (250), fever (224), joint and muscle related ailments (215), gastrointestinal disorders (210), urogenital ailments (199), respiratory ailments (151), body pain (135) and gynecological disorders (127). Conclusions: This is the first study from the J\&K state, which has examined the medicinal plant use in three divisions of J\&K and discussed the promising medicinal plant species with cross-cultural consensus. The analysis of the data suggested that while large numbers of plants are used medicinally in each division, there is a low interregional consensus and high variation between medicinal plants used in these divisions, which is due to both cultural divergence as well as biological distinctness. The issues related to current status of knowledge on medicinal plants used by indigenous communities of J\&K have been discussed and some recommendations have been made for future studies on medicinal plants in J\&K region.

Hence, suitable land uses for a climatic condition are expected to sequester optimum atmospheric carbon in soils. But, information on how climatic conditions and land uses influence carbon accumulation in the soils on the Himalayan Mountains is not known. This study reports the impact of four climatic conditions (sub-tropical, altitude: 500-1200 m; temperate 1200-2000 m; lower alpine 2000-3000 m; upper alpine, 3000-3500 m) and four land uses (forest, grassland, horticulture, agriculture) on the concentrations and stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) in upper (0-30 cm) and deeper (30-100 cm) soil depths on the western Himalayan Mountains of India. The study also explored the drivers which influenced the SOC stock build up on the mountains. Rainfall and soil moisture showed quadratic relations, whereas temperature declined linearly with the altitude. SOC stock as well as concentration was the highest (101.8 Mg ha(-1) in 0-30 cm, 227.97 Mg ha(-1) in 0-100 cm) in temperate and the lowest in subtropical climate (37 Mg ha(-1) in 0-30 cm, 107.04 Mg ha(-1) in 0-100 cm). Pattern of SOC stock build up across the altitude was: temperate>lower alpine>upper alpine>sub-tropical. SOC stocks in all land uses across the climatic conditions, except agriculture in lower alpine, was higher (0.7 to 41.6\%) in the deeper than upper soil depth. SOC stocks in both the depths showed quadratic relations with soil temperature and soil moisture. Other factors like fine soil particles, land-use factor and altitude influenced positively whereas slope and pH, negatively to the SOC stocks. In all climatic conditions, other than temperate, SOC stocks were greater in natural ecosystems like forests and pastures (112.5 to 247.5 Mg ha(-1)) than agriculture (63 to 120.4 Mg ha(-1)). In temperate climate, SOC stock in agriculture (253.6 Mg ha(-1)) on well formed terraces was a little higher than forest (231.3 Mg ha(-1)) on natural slope. These observations, suggest that land uses on temperate climate may be treated as potential sinks for sequestration of the atmospheric carbon. However, agriculture in subtropical climate need to be pursued with due SOC protection measures like the temperate climate for greater sequestration of the atmospheric carbon. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In Sathyamangalam Wildlife Sanctuary, this species use two habitats, namely tropical dry deciduous forest for foraging, and riverine forests for foraging and nesting. Vegetation assessment showed 30 tree species and 43\% of Indian Grey hornbill's food plant species in dry deciduous forests, and 64 species and 38\% of food plant species in the riverine habitat. All the nest trees were in riverine habitat which appears to be crucial for the survival of Indian Grey Hornbill. Due to anthropogenic activities, the hornbill habitats have become degraded. A comparison of vegetation features of the undisturbed dry deciduous forest with that of the degraded forest site revealed the loss of 53\% of tree species and 65\% of food plant species in the degraded site. Hence, habitat restoration efforts have been initiated with the collaboration of the state forest department. As an initial phase, 16 hornbill-dispersed tree species were raised in a nursery. As the hornbill-dispersed tree species are not popular among the foresters, efforts are made to popularize these species, so that these species could be raised and planted in large numbers as part of the ongoing afforestation programme.

Quantification of landscape pattern using landscape metrics help in characterisation of landscapes and thus overall health of the forest cover. Himalayan foothills are one of the most important and fragile landscapes. Developmental activities and depdendence on the forest resources have altered the spatial pattern of these natural landscapes to a great extent. These changes in the landscape were analysed using satellite data from 1990, 2001 and 2006. The vegetation type maps of Dehradun forest division were prepared by supervised classification technique in order to study the landscape dynamics. Patch density, edge density, shape index, cohesion index, interspersion and juxtaposition index, normalised entropy, and relative richness are some important landscape metrics used in the study for quantifying the characteristics of landscape. The landscape metrics analysis and transformation analysis show that the forested areas are getting degraded and physical connectedness between the patches have also decreased making them isolated. The study demonstrates the importance of geospatial tools for monitoring the impact of disturbances on the forest ecosystem health, which can further help in landscape management.","SPRINGER","English","Accuracy assessment; Characterisation; LULC; Himalaya; Landscape; Metrics","0255-660X","10.1007/s12524-010-0046-2","3","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",NA,NA,"441-452","Landscape Characterisation of the Forests of Himalayan Foothills.","selected",NA,"selected"

Maximum release of non-exchangeable K was obtained in temperate zone soils (295 mg kg(-1)) followed by intermediate zone (227 mg kg(-1)) and subtropical zone soils (106 mg kg(-1)), having relative soil quality index (RSQI) values of 85, 80 and 65, respectively. The quantitative analysis of clay minerals, through XRD technique, revealed that the temperate soils have more illite (averaging 62\%) which holds well as a reason for high NEK reserves of 1556 mg kg(-1) in these soils in comparison to intermediate (having illite averaging 53\%) and sub-tropical (having illite averaging to 49\%) soils having NEK amounting to 1022 and 918 mg kg(-1), respectively. In order to study the NEK removal from the soils under investigation, maize was grown as a test crop and potassium was applied through four treatments having four levels of K (0, 15, 30 and 60 mg kg(-1)) applied as KCl. The crop demonstrated significant response in terms of dry matter yield up to 30 mg kg(-1) in sub-tropical and intermediate soils while no such response was obtained in temperate soils. The percent NEK removed by maize crop from NEK reserves was 14, 25 and 20\% in sub-tropical, intermediate and temperate soils. respectively. The information about NEK release, its removal as well as its relationship with K fixing capacity, clay minerals and RSQI can be used for understanding the K buffering potential of soils especially under adverse soil and climatic conditions that prevail in southwest India. Besides, the regression equations developed can be used for predicting NEK release on the basis of K fixing capacity and clay mineralogical composition. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Aerosol particles contain a substantial fraction of strongly absorbing material, including black carbon (BC), organic compounds (OC), and dust all of which can contribute to atmospheric warming, in addition to greenhouse gases. Using a 3-year record of continuous measurements of aerosol optical properties, we present a time series of key climate relevant aerosol properties including the aerosol absorption (sigma(ap)) and scattering (sigma(sp)) coefficients as well as the single-scattering albedo (w(0)). Results of this investigation show substantial seasonal variability of these properties, with long range transport during the pre- and post-monsoon seasons and efficient precipitation scavenging of aerosol particles during the monsoon season. The monthly averaged scattering coefficients range from 0.1 Mm(-1) (monsoon) to 20 Mm(-1) while the average absorption coefficients range from 0.5 Mm(-1) to 3.5 Mm(-1). Both have their maximum values during the pre-monsoon period (April) and reach a minimum during Monsoon (July-August). This leads to dry w(0) values from 0.86 (pre- monsoon) to 0.79 (monsoon) seasons. Significant diurnal variability due to valley wind circulation is also reported. Using aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements, we calculated the resulting direct local radiative forcing due to aerosols for selected air mass cases. We found that the presence of absorbing particulate material can locally induce an additional top of the atmosphere (TOA) forcing of 10 to 20 W m(-2) for the first atmospheric layer (500 m above surface). The TOA positive forcing depends on the presence of snow at the surface, and takes place preferentially during episodes of regional pollution occurring on a very regular basis in the Himalayan valleys. Warming of the first atmospheric layer is paralleled by a substantial decrease of the amount of radiation reaching the surface. The surface forcing is estimated to range from -4 to -20 W m(-2) for small-scale regional pollution events and large-scale pollution events, respectively. The calculated surface forcing is also very dependent on surface albedo, with maximum values occurring over a snow-covered surface. Overall, this work presents the first estimates of aerosol direct radiative forcing over the high Himalaya based on in-situ aerosol measurements, and results suggest a TOA forcing significantly greater than the IPCC reported values for green house gases.","COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","English",NA,"1680-7316","10.5194/acp-10-5859-2010","13","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",NA,NA,"5859-5872","Aerosol Optical Properties and Radiative Forcing in the High Himalaya Based on Measurements at the Nepal Climate Observatory-Pyramid Site (5079 m A.s.l.)","unknown",NA,"excluded"

The objective of this investigation is to provide a methodology to estimate quantitative SLTL for the Shivalik-Himalayan region in India for suggesting suitable soil conservation measures. A quantitative model was used to integrate potential soil indicators such as infiltration rate, bulk density, water stable aggregate, organic carbon and fertility status to assess soil quality governing soil resistibility to erosion. Scaling functions were used to convert soil parameters to unit less 0 to I scale. Normalized values of soil parameters were then multiplied by assigned weights based on relative importance and sensitivity analysis of each indicator. Soils were grouped into 1, 2 and 3 depending on overall additive score. A general guideline developed by the USDA-Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) was followed with certain modifications in depth category for estimation of SLTLs. Soil loss tolerance limits varied from 2.5 to 12.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to single value of 11.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) being followed earlier.

The study area represents climax vegetation and can be broadly classified into tropical, subtropical, temperate and sub-alpine forests. Vegetation pattern in the study area is influenced strongly by altitude, slope, aspect and other climatic factors. The forests are mature, undisturbed and intermixed with close canopy. Rugged terrain and elevation also affect the reflectance. Because of these discrimination among the various forest/vegetation types is restrained on satellite data. Therefore, satellite data in optical region have limitations in pattern recognition due to similarity in spectral response caused by several factors. Since vegetation is controlled by elevation among other factors, digital elevation model (DEM) was integrated with the LISS III multiband data. The overall accuracy improved from 40.81 to 83.67\%. Maximum-forested area (252.80 km(2)) in national park is covered by sub-tropical evergreen forest followed by temperate broad-leaved forest (147.09 km2).

The sub-watershed located at Jakhan rao area of Western Dun in lower Himalayan belt was taken as the test site for the study at 1 : 50,000 scale. Deforestation, unscientific agricultural practices, terrace farming, cattle grazing and land degradation in the sub-watershed are some of the anthropogenic factors causing soil erosion in the area.

This study contributes example from human shaped ecosystem in mountainous regions where fragmentation of natural resources is active. The remote sensing and GIS has been used to understand the land cover dynamics along the topography. The results report that the land cover dynamics is dependent on the aspect due to sun illumination. The altitude and slope are no more a barrier for resource extraction and the human activity zone is shifting towards higher altitudes and slopes. The changes are also defined along the road and settlements.","SPRINGER","English",NA,"0255-660X","10.1007/BF03030876","2","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",NA,NA,"199-208","Land Cover Dynamics in Garhwal Himalayas - a Case Study of Balkhila Sub-Watershed.","unknown",NA,"excluded"
